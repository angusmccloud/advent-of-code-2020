Calvin: Well, go easy this time. Hobbes: Think I should shave? Calvin: No, go for the Don Johnson fuzzy look. Here&#39;s a tie and one of my sport coats. Perfect! Right out of &quot;GQ&quot;!

I know, let&#39;s just dump the worms in the water, and when the fish come up to eat them, we&#39;ll catch them in the net!  Pretty smart, huh? That&#39;s what I like about surviving in the wild--pitting our wits against the raging elements! Hobbes: The worms are getting soggy.  Calvin: OOoh.  They&#39;re starting to sink.  Let&#39;s pit our wits against some fast food cheeseburgers. Those come in neat little boxes.  Hobbes: Yeah, who&#39;d want to eat something that eats worms anyway?

Calvin:  Eighteen?!?  By then I&#39;ll know better! Mom, can I have a cigarette?  Mom:  Sure, Calvin.  I think your grandfather left some here.  Just smoke outside, ok?  Calvin: Wow!  Hobbes:  Your Mom let you have a cigarette?  Calvin:  For a mom, sometimes she&#39;s pretty cool.  EEEEEEP. Blaaugh!  Gag. Hack. Cough.  Ack Wheeze.

I signed you up for swimming lessons. Calvin: I don&#39;t want swimming lessons!! Mom: Too late. Let&#39;s go. Calvin: What about Hobbes? Did you sign him up too? Mom: No. It&#39;s not good to get tigers wet. Calvin: Why is that? Hobbes: It takes us all day to dry, and until we do, we smell funny.

Here I am freezing my buns off at 9 in the morning. About to jump into the ice water and drown. The only thing that could possibly make this worse would be if the class was... ...Taught by my sadistic babysitter!! Rosalyn: Well, look who&#39;s here!

Everyone in the water! Calvin: I refuse! I&#39;m freezing already! Rosalyn: Calvin, do you know what a &quot;rat tail&quot; is? Calvin: No. Rosalyn: It&#39;s when you soak a towel and twist it up into a whip. It stings like crazy and is much worse than being cold. Get my drift? Calvin: I always thought lifeguards were just taught how to resuscitate people and things like that.

I&#39;m going to go into shock and drown, I just know it. I bet the lifeguard is involved in some insurance scam and she&#39;s going to let us all drown like rats! Oh no! Oh no! Rosalyn: Ok, first we&#39;re going to learn the &quot;Deadman&#39;s float.&quot; Calvin: Mom!! Helpp! Helpp! Rosalyn: What I put up with to pay for college...

Why did you sign me up for this? Why not something fun, like hang gliding or sharpshooting? ...Or driving lessons! I could be taking driving lessons and learning something useful! Mom: How about piano lessons? You start Tuesday. Calvin: Ack! No no no no no no no no no no

He&#39;s caught in a spider web!  Thrashing about in a desperate bid for freeedom, he only becomes more entangled! Soon the spider will suck out his innards! Help!

Susie: Thanks, Calvin. That&#39;s really nice of you. Ok, we&#39;ll play house nos. I&#39;ll be the high powered executive wife, the tiger here can ve my unemployed, housekeeping husband, and you can be our bratty and brainless kid in a day care center.

It must be a fossil! I wonder what peculiar animal this was. But it&#39;s not a bone. It must be some primitive hunting weapon or eating utensil for cave men. Maybe it had some religious function. Hobbes: This explains why your clothes stay on the floor.

Mom: No. Calvin: Why not? Mom: You&#39;ll get soaked. Calvin: What&#39;s wrong with that? Mom: You could catch pneumonia, run up a terrible hospital bill, linger a few months, and die. Calvin: I always forget. If you ask mom, you get a worst-case scenario. Hobbes: I had no idea these little showers were so dangerous.

Higher and higher, as upward he falls! Only by grabbing the tail fin of a passing jet does Calvin save himself from being hurled out into space!  Dad: No, no let him finish. This is very interesting.  So after you landed in Phoenix, what happened?  Mom: Well, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m not sewing velcro on the ouside of all his clothes.  Calvin: Well, about then my gravity came back, so I...

Mom: I&#39;m still working on it. I wish your class would do somethink a little less elaborate. I&#39;m not much of a seamstress. Just be glad I&#39;m not Russy White. He has to be an amino acid. Mom: Mm... What do you think? Calvin: Jabba the Hutt meets Rudolf the reindeer. I dunno, Mom.

It&#39;s not even dark out! Well, she can put us to bed, but she can&#39;t make up sleep. You play the horn, and I&#39;ll accompany on tom-tom.

She was just about to taste the porridge when the three tigers came home.&quot; Dad: &quot;They quickly divided Goldilocks into big, medium, and small pieces and dunked them in the porridge that...&quot; Dad: Calvin, I&#39;m not going to finish this! This is disgusting!! Dad: I don&#39;t know why I let you talk me into this. Good night! Calvin: He didn&#39;t even look at our illustrations. Hobbes: Now I&#39;m all hungry.

I never get to do what I want! If I grow up to be some sort of psychopath because of this, you&#39;ll all be sorry!!

Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean...an undersea nuclear explosion awakens a giant prehistoric monster! It makes its way to the coast of Japan and emerges! Yaarghhh.  Calvin: He heads for the power lines, leaving a trail of destruction behind! Dad: Calvin, get back in the tub! You&#39;re making a mess! Calvin: His ancient arch-rival Megalon! He spews a mighty fireball! Aauuughh...Tokyo is in ruins! Megalon vanquished! He returns to the sea from whence he came! Dad: No more afternoon TV movies for you! Ever!!

Dad: Sure, Calvin. What do you want to know? Calvin: If you plugged you nose and mouth right before you sneezed... ...Would the sneeze go out your ears, or would your head explode? Dad: I was kind or hoping you had a math problem or something. Calvin: ...Either way, I&#39;m scared to try it.

Hobbes: Why is that? Calvin: There&#39;s no way to steer. Calvin: On these cloudy winter days, sometimes I like to lie back on my sled and look at the sky. Calvin: It&#39;s just grey and silent. No birds singing or bugs buzzing. Everything is muffled by the snow. Calvin: Imagine what it would be like without any people or houses around. It would be perfectly still. Calvin: Pretty neat, huh? Hobbes: Yes, very peaceful. Hobbes: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa Calvin: I hate all that silence.

It&#39;s unique design sends a blinding spray of snow on its passengers at the slightest bump. Note, too, the lack of any steering mechanism. Yes, this sled is truly a hazard to life and limb. Wheee oonph! Eeeee....

Can&#39;t we turn the heat up? Mom: Heat is expensive, Calvin. Just put on a sweater. Calvin: Look, the thermostat goes all the way up to 90 degrees! We could be sitting around in our shorts! MoM: Leave the thermostat alone, Calvin. Calvin: I can almost see my breath. I&#39;ll just crank it up to 75, Ok? Mom: I said don&#39;t touch it!

There&#39;s a fire made. Why don&#39;t you go warm up? Calvin: Oh, boy! Nothing beats sitting by a roaring fire after you&#39;ve been out in the cold. Of course, some people say why bother going outside first?

Mom: No, why do you ask? Calvin: Are you planning to put me to work in a cannery for 14 hours a day when I turn seven? Mom: Of course not! Calvin: You&#39;re not just fattening me up to eat me, are you? Mom: Good heavens, Calvin! Who put all these rediculous ideas in your head?!? Calvin: That right. &quot;Rediculous ideas&quot; she called them. Hobbes: Oh, sure, you think your mom&#39;s going to tell you?

You&#39;ll miss all those trees. You can do it. You&#39;ll stop before you go over that ledge at the bottom. You won&#39;t go into that pond. Besides, the ice is probably real thick anyway. Go ahead down. My brain is trying to kill me.

We&#39;ll have a good long ride down!  Hobbes:  Provided we improve our steering.  Calvin:  Hobbes, do you think human nature is good or evil?  Hobbes:  Watch out for those trees.  Calvin:  I mean, do you think people are basically good, with a few bad tendencies, or basically bad, with a few good tnedencies!  Hobbes:  There&#39;s a rock up ahead!  Look out!  Calvin:  Or, as a third possiblity do you think people are just crazy, and who knows why they do anything?  Hobbes:  Not so close to the ledge!  Calvin:  Well?  What do you think?  Are people good, bad or crazy!  Hobbes: Aughhh!  I can&#39;t look!   Wump!  Calvin:  You know, it&#39;s very rude of you to keep changing the subject after every sentence.  Hobbes:  I choose crazy.

Why does he call me names for no reason? It&#39;s just mean. I wish I had a hundred friends. Then I wouldn&#39;t care. I&#39;d say, &quot;Who needs you, Calvin? I&#39;ve got a hundred other friends!&quot; Then my hundred friends and I would go do something fun, and leave Calvin all alone! Ha! ...And as long as I&#39;m dreaming, I&#39;d like a pony.

What&#39;s it say?? Read it already!! Hobbes: Probably some big state dinner. I hope I can find my cummerbund.

It&#39;s an invitation to Susie Derkins&#39; birthday party. How nice. Calvin: Susie invited you? What about me? Does it say me too? Hobbes: No, it doesn&#39;t say anything about you. Calvin: She must have mailed my invitation separately. She probably wanted to insure if so she&#39;ll kow it didn&#39;t get lost. Sometimes those take longer. I&#39;ll have to sign for it and all.

Hobbes: I think we should get her a can of tuna fish. Calvin: Tuna fish? Why would she want that?

It&#39;s too late for you to change yor mind, right? Calvin: Not so fast...my hnad&#39;s still on it. Hobbes: Jump, jump, jump! I win! Calvin: You win?!? Aaugghh! You won last time! I hate it when you win! Calvin: Aarrggh! Mff! Gnnk! I hate this game! I hate the whole world!! Aghhh! What a supid game. Calvin: You must have cheated!

So from dinner till bed is now designated as &quot;homework time.&quot; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair! If it doesn&#39;t take that long to do, why should I have to stay in my room all that time?

He lives in a 5 acre home in a wealthy suburb.  Here is his new Mercedes in the driveway.  It&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess as to how much longer Mr. Jones can meet his monthy finance charges. Here comes Mr. Jones out of his attractive suburban home.  He hops in his red sports car.  Off he goes to work.  80...90..100 miles an hour! ...along the edge of the Grand Canyon!!  Suddenly, his steering locks and his brakes fail!  He careens over the edge!  Oh no!  Down he goes! His only hope is to climb out the sun roof and jump!  Maybe, just maybe, he can grab  a branch and save himself!  He unwinds the sun roof!  Can he make it??  No!  The car explodes in mid-air, propelling millions of tiny shards into the stratosphere!  Kablooie!  The neighbors hear the boom echoing across the canyon.  They pile into a min-van to investigate!  What will happen to them?

Can he make it??  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna make it.  Mom:  There&#39;s a gas station up ahead.  Just hold on.  Dad:  Didn&#39;t I tell you not to drink so much before we left??

Calvin: This all seems baguely familiar...and yet... ...and yet... Dad: You&#39;re asking for an early bedtime, kid. Mom: Well, he seems to remember he likes dessert, anyway. Calvin: This is &quot;dessert,&quot; you say? Hmm. Perhaps my memory would return if I had some more. Dad: That&#39;s it. Bed!

Since you sont stop it. You&#39;re going to bed. You can let me know if you want to be serious. Calvin: *wink* Aauughh! Mister, there&#39;s a tiger in this room!!

Education is very important. That&#39;s why this amnesia game has to stop. No more &quot;forgetting&quot; to do your homework. Ok? Calvin: Ok, Mister. Dad: Ok? Calvin: ...Uh, Dad. Right, Dad. You got it.

How is your math class going now? Calvin: Um...I&#39;m doing great. Dad: How great? Calvin: Real great. Dad: Have you been passing all your quizzes? Calvin: I didn&#39;t say phenomenal.

Hobbes:  Yaaaaa!  Calvin:  Aauugh!  Hobbes:  I thought that after seven boring hours at school, you might appreciate one moment of pure abject terror.  Calvin:  Let me up to get my bat and I&#39;ll thank you.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|9|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/09|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7c9c2610deba01317193005056a9545d|302|900|Calvin: Hobbes, look! There&#39;s a little raccoon on the ground. Hobbes: Is it alive? Calvin: I think so, but he&#39;s hurt. See, he&#39;s hardly breathing. Hobbes: Better not touch him if he&#39;s hurt. Calvin: Yeah. You wait here and guard him. I&#39;ll run and get Mom. Hobbes: I sure hope she can help. Calvin: Of course she can! You don&#39;t get to be a mom if you can&#39;t fix everything just right.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7dfc4d60deba01317193005056a9545d|308|900|Calvin: There&#39;s Hobbes guarding him, Mom. The little raccoon&#39;s right over there! Mom: Ooh, Calvin. I don&#39;t know if we can save him. He looks pretty bad. Go get a shoe box and a clean dish towel. Calvin: Right! MoM: I don&#39;t think this poor little guy is going to make it, Hobbes. (sigh) I hate it when these things happen. ...You can tell I&#39;m upset when I start talking to you...
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7f6210f0deba01317193005056a9545d|298|900|Mom: Well, I got him in the shoe box. I guess all we can do is keep him warm and safe. We&#39;ll keep him in the garage, and put out some water and food. Calvin: I read in a book that raccoons will eat just about anything. Chances are, I&#39;ll be happy to donate most of my dinner. Mom: Calvin, you don&#39;t even know what were having.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/80c586c0deba01317193005056a9545d|305|900|Hobbes: Has he eaten anything. Calvin: No. Don&#39;t die, little raccoon. It wouldn&#39;t be very grateful of you to break my heart.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8233aa10deba01317193005056a9545d|296|900|Hobbes: I can&#39;t sleep. Calvin: Me either. I keep thinking about the raccoon. Hobbes: I hope he lives. Calvin: Me too. Hobbes: I think animals are always so cute.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8391e4e0deba01317193005056a9545d|292|900|Calvin: Dad, did you check on the little raccoon this morning? Dad: Yes, Calvin. ...I&#39;m afraid he died. Calvin: Waahhhh!! Dad: I&#39;m sorry too, kiddo. But he didn&#39;t have much of a chance. Calvin: Wahhaahh! Dad: At least he died warm and safe, Calvin. We did all we could but now he&#39;s gone. Calvin: *sniff* ...I know. I&#39;m crying because out there he&#39;s gone, but he&#39;s not gone inside me.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/6fb71300ded9013171bc005056a9545d|640|900|Calvin:  Here&#39;s a photo I took of you.  Hobbes:  The picture is kind of fuzzy.  Calvin:  You&#39;re kind of fuzzy!  Ok, make a face!  Hobbes:  Howth thith?  Calvin:  Great! Hold it!  Hobbes:  Let&#39;s see! Let&#39;s see!  Calvin:  It&#39;s developing!  I can start to see it!  Hobbes:  There I am!  Look! Look! Calvin:  Ha! Ha! It&#39;s great!  What a photograph! Calvin and Hobbes:  Hee ha ha hee hoo ha ha!  Ha ha hee ha ho ho ho!  Calvin:  Let&#39;s take some more!  That&#39;s it.  Bug your eyes out!  Hobbes:  Hee hee! Hurry up!  Dad:  All these pictures are of Hobbes?!  Calvin:  Aren&#39;t they a scream?  Can I have ten bucks for another roll of film?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/84f5a360deba01317193005056a9545d|299|900|Calvin: This is where Dad buried the little raccoon. I didnt&#39; even know he existed a few days ago and now he&#39;s gone forever. It&#39;s like I found him for no reason. I had to say good-bye as soon as I said hello. Still...in a sad, awful, terrible way, I&#39;m happy I met him. *sniff* What a stupid world.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/86531130deba01317193005056a9545d|298|900|Calvin: You know, Hobbes, I can&#39;t figure out this death stuff. Why did that little raccoon have to die? He didn&#39;t do anything wrong. He was just little! What&#39;s the point of putting him here and taking him back so soon?!? It&#39;s either mean or, it&#39;s arbitrary, and either way I&#39;ve got the heebie-jeebies. Hobbes: Why is it always night when we talk about these things?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/87b6d190deba01317193005056a9545d|295|900|Calvin: Mom says death is as natural as birth, and it&#39;s all part of the life cycle. She says we don&#39;t really understand it, but there are many things we don&#39;t understand, and we jsut have to do the best we can with the knowledgs we have. I guess that makes sense. ..But don&#39;t you go anywhere. Hobbes: Don&#39;t worry.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/890e5630deba01317193005056a9545d|309|900|Calvin: Hey! What happened to the trees here? Who cleared out the woods. There used to be lots of animals in these woods! Now it&#39;s a mud pit! Hobbes: This sign says, &quot;Future site of Shady acres condominiums.&quot; Calvin: Animals can&#39;t afford condos! Hobbes: &quot;Shady acres&quot;? The only shade I see is from that bulldozer.

By golly, how would people like it if animals bulldozed a suburb and put in new trees?!? Hobbes: No good. They didn&#39;t leave the keys.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8bd0eb60deba01317193005056a9545d|299|900|Calvin: It took hundreds of years for these woods to grow, and they leveled it in a week. It&#39;s gone. After they build the new houses, here, they&#39;ll have to widen the roads and put up gas stations, and pretty soon this whole are will just be a big strip. Eventually there won&#39;t be a nice spot left anywhere. I wonder if you can refuse to inherit the world. Hobbes: I think if you&#39;re born, it&#39;s too late.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/aeb3acf2250b102d94d7001438c0f03b|427|600|TV:  Kablooie!  Ooooh!  You&#39;re twicked me for the wast time, wabbit!  Calvin:  Ha ha ha!  Boy, I wish I had some dynamite! Boy, I love weekends!  What better way to spend one&#39;s freedom than eating chocolate cereal and watching cartoons!  Hobbes:  Mm...I beg to differ on the cereal part.  Dad:  Calvin, you&#39;ve been sitting in front of that stupid TV all morning!  It&#39;s a beautiful day!  You should be outside!  It&#39;s going to be a grim day when the world is run by a generation that doesn&#39;t know anything but what it&#39;s seen on TV!  How can you sit inside all day?  Go on!  Out! Out!  Kids are supposed to run around in the fresh air!  Have some fun! Get some exercise!  Door:  Slam!  Calvin:  Well, I guess that&#39;s that.  Come on.  Hi, Susie, are you watching TV? Can we come in?  Susie:  Sure, hurry up!  It&#39;s a commercial.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8d40c700deba01317193005056a9545d|312|900|Calvin: Hobbes, want to see my transmogrifier? Hobbes: I didn&#39;t know you had a transmogrifier. Calvin: I just got it. You step into this chamber, set the appropriate dials, and it turns you into whatever you&#39;d like to be. Hobbes: It&#39;s amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days. Calvin: Isn&#39;t it?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8e9507d0deba01317193005056a9545d|301|900|Calvin: This transmogrifier will turn you into anything at all. All you do is set this indicator, and the machine automatically restructures your chemical configuration. You can be an eel, a babboon, a gaint bug, or a dinosaur. Hobbes: What if you want to be something else? Calvin: I left some room. Just write it on the side.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/9017a1d0deba01317193005056a9545d|310|900|Calvin: Well, what do you say? Would you like to be transmogrified? Hobbes: I don&#39;t think so. Being a tiger is my area of expertise. Calvin: Don&#39;t be scared. The process is instantaneous and completely painless. Just think! WIth the push of a button, you could be a 500-story gastropod - a slug the size of the Chrysler building! Hobbes: Gosh, how can I refuse? Calvin: Well if you don&#39;t like that, be something else! I don&#39;t care!
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/91826520deba01317193005056a9545d|304|900|Calvin: Look, if you can&#39;t make up your mind. I&#39;ll go first and turn myself into something. I&#39;ll show you. Hobbes: But what&#39;s the point of turning yourself into something else? No one&#39;s done it! Think of the knowledge to be gained! Hobbes: What horrors we visit upon ourselves in the name of science. Calvin: Ok, I&#39;m in. Set the dial on &quot;Lungfish.&quot; ...No, make it &quot;Musk ox.&quot; ...no...
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/92df27c0deba01317193005056a9545d|299|900|Hobbes: What are you going to transmogrify into? Calvin: How about a tiger? Hobbes: That&#39;s a good idea. The world can always use another tiger. Calvin: Just turn the arrow and push the button, then. Hobbes: All right, here you go. Calvin: Zap! Hobbes: Did it work? Calvin: Boy, I&#39;m hot. How do you stand having all this fur?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/9446da50deba01317193005056a9545d|301|900|Hobbes: So you&#39;re a tiger now? Calvin: Yet. Let me out. Hobbes: Words fail me. Calvin: I&#39;m disappointed too, but keep in mine transmogrification is a new technology.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|29|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/29|https://assets.amuniversal.com/727a13f0ded9013171bc005056a9545d|658|900|Calvin:  Thanks for the lunch, Mom!  I&#39;m going outside.  Refueled, the 727 taxis onto the runway. Control tower to Calvin, you are cleared for take off.  Roger.  Full throttle!  Fwoooshh!  Take off!  Landing gear up!  Chugunk!  We have reached our cruising altitude of 30,000 feet.  A small, tasteless snack will be served shortly.  This is your Captain speaking, I&#39;m afraid our arrival will be slightly delayed.  We&#39;re stacked up over Washington, and we&#39;ll be in a holding pattern for another 40 minutes.  Tower to Calvin, you are now cleared for landing.  Roger..Landing gear down!  Reverse thrust!  Mom:  I saw you outside running in circles for almost an hour!  Are you trying to make yourself sick?  Calvin:  Oog.  From now on, I&#39;m playing &quot;bus.&quot;
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/95ba40f0deba01317193005056a9545d|301|900|Hobbes: So Calvin, What&#39;s it like to be a tiger now? Calvin: Kinda fuzzy, but not that different. Hobbes: So! What do you want to talk about? Calvin: Do we eat soon?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|3|31|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/03/31|https://assets.amuniversal.com/97282010deba01317193005056a9545d|296|900|Calvin: Hi, Mom! Will you make Hobbes and me a big tuna sandwich? Mom: I thought you hated tuna fish. Calvin: Not anymore. I&#39;m a tiger now. Mom: I thought Hobbes was your tiger. Calvin: Now I&#39;m one, too. I transmogrified. Mom: Oh, I see. Calvin: My, she&#39;s taking this well. But this strain will surely crack her soon.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|4|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/04/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/9882d8f0deba01317193005056a9545d|299|900|Dad: I&#39;m home! Calvin: Hi, Dad. Notice anything different about me? Dad: Uh...new haircut? Calvin: Geez. Did you go blind?? I&#39;m a tiger! Dad: Oh, I thought you meant besides that Calvin. Your dad&#39;s very tired, and... Mom: Hope you want tuna for dinner, Dear...

Just set the dial to &quot;Calvin,&quot; and I&#39;ll transmogrify back to a boy. Hobbes: Here you go. Calvin: Zap! Hobbes: Oops! Calvin: Try again, Lunkhead.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|4|3|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/04/03|https://assets.amuniversal.com/9b41e7d0deba01317193005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin: Here I am, back to being Calvin. Hobbes: Your machines works amazingly well. Calvin: It&#39;s my own design. Hobbes: What will you do with it now? Calvin: Good question. ...Although I suppose we could turn Susie into a bowl of chowder if we could just get her into the machine. Susie: Leave me out of your life&#39;s plans, you little weirdo.

He begins to swell! Inflating like a raft, he grows bigger and bigger! Oh no! How much larger can he get? Oooh. I think I&#39;m going to explode. Mom: No wonder! I&#39;ve never seen anyone eat som much in one sitting! I hope you learned a little lesson.

See Spot.  See Spot run.  Run, Spot, run.  Jane sees Spot run.  Way to go, Jane!  Boy, I hate homework.  Yahh!  Hey!  Whoop!  Yow! Whoa! Stop!  Aaaughh!! Gaackk! Help! Help!  Whap!!  Bonk! Bonk!  Mom:  What on earth are you doing?  Where&#39;s your homework?  Calvin:   I couldn&#39;t concentrate.

Calvin: Oh no! Why is it you always rip your pants on the day everyone has to demonstrate a math problem at the chalkboard?

Recess is over. I&#39;m supposed to be back in class! I can&#39;t go in like this! What am I going to do?? ...Of all the days to wear the underpants with little rocket ships...

His parents, engrossed in culture, remain blissfully unaware of Calvin&#39;s terrible transformation.  Yes, a Tyrannosaurus is loose in the art museum!  The curator shrieks and pandemonium ensues!  A guard reaches for his pistol, but the dinosaur is upon him and he is messily devoured!  The giant lizard&#39;s glory is captured forever on film by the anti-theft cameras!  Patrons of the arts flee for their lives!  Hundreds of priceless paintings are ripped to shreds in the awful rampage!  Wealthy benefactors are trampled, the museum is in ruins!  On to symphony hall!! Dad:  Calvin?  Cavin?  We&#39;re in the next room now.  C&#39;mon.  I think we&#39;d better get him out of here.  He had that grin again.  Calvin:  I wanna see the dinosaurs at the natural history museum again.  Mom:  We spent all afternoon there, Calvin.

Calvin: Here comes the hurricane. Mom: You cut your hair!! Calvin: No I didn&#39;t, Hobbes did. Mom: Why on earth did you cut your own hair?! Look at you! Calvin: I said Hobbes cut it! You think I&#39;d do this?? ...Well, I didn&#39;t!

Mom says theres nothing I can do but wait for my hair to grow back. In the meantime, I&#39;ve got to go around looking like I&#39;ve got mange! I hope you&#39;re happy. Hobbes: Happy?! You stiffed me! Where&#39;s my eight bucks?!

I didn&#39;t mean to. Calvin: A fat lot of good that does me. Hobbes: I can make it up to you, honest. Calvin: Yeah? How? Hobbes: I bought a yellow magic marker. See, I&#39;ll just draw some hair on. There, it&#39;s looking better already. Calvin: Really? Is it?

Calvin; Thanks, Hobbes. You&#39;re a real lifesaver. I&#39;m sorry I got so mad at you. Hobbes: Nonsense, no harm done. Calvin: Boy, wait till I show mom! Hobbes: Uh oh. Does it come off? Calvin: From now on, just keep your brainy ideas to yourself, OK?

This must be the biggest hill in the state.  Calvin:  kind of frustrating, isn&#39;t it?  I wish Dad would get transferred to the Andes.  Let&#39;s go down the hill and see if we can travel into the future.  Hobbes:  Go into the future?  How?  Calvin:  It&#39;s easy!  All we have to do is get going real fast and we&#39;ll time-warp!  Ha ha! Faster! Faster!  Hobbes: Gosh, what do you suppose the future will be like?  calvin:  Who knows?  Flying cars and cities built on clouds maybe!  Just think of all the weird things we can tell people we saw!  Oh boy!  Hey, we&#39;re at the bottom of the hill.  I didn&#39;t feel any time warp, did you?  Hobbes:  Nope.  Calvin:  But look!  It&#39;s two minutes later than when we started!  We&#39;re in the future!!  Hobbes:  Hmm...things haven&#39;t improved.  I&#39;m disappointed.

Yaaaa aaaugh! Yowp! Arrgh! Yip! (pant pant) Why do you always do that?! Hobbes: Natural exuberance is one of those qualities that makes us tigers so darn endearing!

It&#39;s sure to be another &quot;homer,&quot; folks. Here&#39;s the pitch! Bonk! Not surprisingly, the pitcher decides to &quot;walk&quot; Calvin.

He is 2-D!  Thinner than a sheet of paper, Calvin has no surface area on the bottom of his feet!  He is immobile!  Only by &quot;waving&quot; his body can Calvin create enough friction with the ground to move!  Having width but no thickness, Calvin is vulnerable to the slightest gust of wind!  To avoid drafts, he twists himself into a tube, and rolls across the floor!  Someone is coming!  Calvin quickly stands up straight.  Turning perfectly sideways, he is a nearly invisible vertical line!  No one will notice!  Hey Dad, know why you didn&#39;t see me all morning??  I was two-dimensional!  Dad:  Hmmm, I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t do it all afternoon, too... Mom:  Dear!

Hobbes: What for? Calvin: So we can see if you have ESP. Hobbes: Ok, I predict you&#39;ll find an irresistible attraction to a mud hole. Calvin: Ha ha. You stay away from me.

I have to go to the bathroom! The monsters will get me as soon as I set foot on the floor! Hobbes: I know! Put your pillow down as a decoy. While they&#39;re eating that, you can slip out. Calvin: Great idea! I&#39;m coming out of bed now! Here I am, all fat and squishy! Hobbes: They took it! Man look at the feathers fly! You&#39;d better hurry!

Calvin:  That&#39;s hard to believe.  I&#39;ve played before and I can tell you the temptation to misuse these things is awful.  Hey, don&#39;t put the wickets so far apart.  Hobbes:  This is the way they&#39;re supposed to be.  Calvin:  No it isn&#39;t, you big cheater.  You&#39;re just doing this because you can hit the ball harder than I can.  Hobbes:  Cheater?  Who took the lucky red ball when I wasn&#39;t looking?  Calvin:  I got to pick first because you did last time!  Hobbes:  That&#39;s a lie!  You always take the lucky red ball first!  Calvin:  Call me a liar, will you? Well, you&#39;re just a poop head! So there!  Thbpbpthpt!  Hobbes:  Potty mouth! Potty mouth!  Calvin is a potty mouth!

Mosquitos don&#39;t even have teeth!  That shows how dumb you are!  Hobbes:  Compared to you, I&#39;m Einstein!  Leggo my leg!  Calvin:  Ow!  Go stick your nose in a rubber hose, you walking flea condo!  Hobbes:  I&#39;d say it takes one to know one, Bozo!  Why don&#39;t you go play in the food processor!

Although this condition will facilitate future medical diagnoses, it does make Calvin&#39;s presence at the dinner table a disgusting ordeal! Everyone can see Calvin&#39;s food being ground into mushy pulp and swallowed! At this moment, Calvin, chews up a large spoonful of creamed corn! Dad: For gosh sakes, close your mouth when you chey!! You think we want to see that?! Calvin: Mkghh! Smack! Blaghkh!

Hobbes: Here&#39;s a steamshovel scooping out a giant hole. Calvin: Here comes the bulldozer pushing thousands of barrels of toxic nuclear waste into the giant hole. Over the years, these dangerous poisons seep into underground waterways. The cancer rate of the nearby little town triples. Hobbes: If you want me, I&#39;ll be under the bed.

That pitch was four feet above my head! Hobbes: Ha! It was a perfect pitch! You&#39;re jsut too short! Calvin: Yeah! Well, you&#39;re just too stupid! Hobbes: Well, you&#39;re just too ugly!

Hold all my calls.  Calvin looks around.  Something is different.  The odd-colored tree behind him slowly lifts up!  It&#39;s not a tree at all!  It&#39;s a leg.  Oh no!  Calvin is the size of a bug to a bug!  He runs for his life!  A claw crashes with deafening impact!  The bug is trying to step on Calvin!  What a horrible fate!  Calvin scrambles madly, promising himself that we&#39;ll never squish another bug if he lives to return to normal size!  Suddenly in a spray of slime, the bug is gone!  A monstrous frog licks it&#39;s chops!  Calvin is saved!  Mom:  Aacck!  What&#39;s that on my plate?!  Good Heavens, get it off the table!!  Calvin:  But Mom, frogs are our friends.

He&#39;s still reading that brief. Look out the window, Dad! Hobbes: Did you bring any rocks? I didn&#39;t think to.

Let&#39;s go. Hobbes: If he had noticed us, we could&#39;ve given him a ride home. Calvin: Hmph, I say let him take the smelly ol&#39; bus if he can&#39;t even look out the window once in a while. Serves him right.

If you&#39;re thinking of running for &quot;Dad&quot; again, you&#39;d better get your campaign in gear. Frankly, the polls look grim. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve got much of a shot at keeping the office. Dad: I take comfort in the fact that not many people would want it. Calvin: Flippant remarks have a way of haunting candidates, you know.

Amazingly, the lizard changes color to blend in with his surroundings. Moments later. He is virtually invisible. Mom: I see you hiding back there! Now come clean up this mess you made in the kitchen!

There&#39;s a monster horsefly on your head. POW! Can you believe it? I missed! So excuse me for trying to help! You wann a scratch a stinging welt all day? Fine! Go away! Claivn: No, wait. There&#39;s a mosquito on you.

Dad: I&#39;m busy, Calvin. Calvin: You know, Dad, It won&#39;t be long before I&#39;m all grown up. One day you&#39;ll wake up and wonder how all the years slipped by. You&#39;ll look back and say, &quot;Where has all the time gone? Calvin&#39;s so big. It&#39;s hard to remember when he was small enough that I could give him horsey rides.&quot; ...But those days will be lost forever. Dad: I think I&#39;ve worked through my potential guilt now. Calvin: No. No! Jump the fence!

Hobbes: &quot;Dragonflies and katydids, but mostly chewed-up little kids.&quot; Calvin: Oh, that&#39;s clever.

Why won&#39;t you eat this big, fat, juicy worm?  Besides the obvious, I mean.  Boy, I hate fishing. This is so boring.  Look, I can see a whole bunch of fish down there, but they&#39;re not biting!  Lousy fish!  By golly, I&#39;m not going to sit here all day waiting for them to get hungry!  Here, help me carry this rock.  We&#39;ll dump it in the water and blast the fish out.  Then we can just pick &#39;em up.  Heave!  Ok, it was a bad idea!  But I got wet too, right?  Hobbes:  No, no, your idea was fine!  We just didn&#39;t throw in a big enough object!

Please? ...Pleeeaase? Hobbes: I still don&#39;t think giving her &quot;Bambi Eyes&quot; is going to get you a flame thrower. Calvin: Maybe I should sniffle a little, too, huh?

Hobbes: Your rear hasn&#39;t lit, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re wondering. Calvin: I can&#39;t even tell what muscle to flex.

Hobbes: An antelope?! Calvin: C&#39;mon! See, she&#39;s coming down the ladder to her boyfriends car! You&#39;re not laughing. Hobbes: It&#39;s not funny.

So when does Paul Revere ride through town and give us out presents?

Spaceman Spiff is hit!  It never fails, I just washed and waxed this thing. Our hero, the intrepid Spaceman Spiff, struggles with the control of his damaged spacecraft!  The freem propulsion blasters are useless!  Spiff crashed onto the surface of an alien planet!  Unscathed, the fearless space explorer emerges from the smoldering wreckage!  He is marooned on a hostile world!  Scorched by twin suns, the planet is nothing but barren rock and methane!  There&#39;s no hope of finding food or water!  Spiff collapses!  Oh no, a hideous alien spots him!  In his weakened state, Spiff is no match for the monster!  This could be the end!!  Lunchtime! Mom:  I brought you a sandwich and some lemonade.  Bring the dishes back when you&#39;re done, ok?  Calvin:  Oh, well.  Thanks, Mom.

Is it money, power or fame? I&#39;d choose money, ir you have enough money, you can buy power and fame. That way you&#39;d have it all and be really happy! Happiness is being famous for your financial ability to indulge in every kind of escess. Hobbes: I suppose that&#39;s one way to define it. Calvin: The part I think I&#39;d like best is crushing people who get in my way.

Somebody poured new cement! Hobbes: Is anyone looking? We could write our initials in it, or make a hand print, or something! Calvin: Yeah! &quot;Or something&quot;! I think we&#39;d better find a hose quick! Hobbes: I didn&#39;t think it would set up so fast.

I&#39;ve got a brand new toy for you.   Hobbes:  Uh oh, I think I saw a tentacle under the bed!  Calvin:  Monsters!  Hobbes:  Turn on the lights!  That makes monsters shrivel up.  Calvin:  Good idea.  Voice:  Aaggghh! Aieeeee aahhhhhh!! gaackk!  Hobbes:  Ha ha, we got &#39;em!  Calvin:  Just the ones under the bed.  We&#39;d better open up the drawers and closet too, and get some light in those places!  By golly, no monsters are going to get us tonight!  Wither and die, bloodsucking freaks of nature!  Dad:  Why is your light on?  What in the world are you doing?  Calvin:  Mosters, Dad.  They could be anywhere.  Dad:  You&#39;re trashing your room at 1:00 in the morning, looking for mosters?!  If you don&#39;t get in bed this instant, you&#39;ll have a lot more to worry about than stupid monsters!!  Calvin:  What we need is some way to shrivel him up.

Calvin: Shhh! Quiet down or you&#39;ll give away my position. Hobbes and I are having a water fight. Susie: A water fight! Can I play? Calvin: You? Ha! War is a manly art! Susie: I suppose anything so idiotic would have to be. Can I play in your game or not? Calvin: I don&#39;t know, it seems you&#39;d rather be making smart remarks.

I have my own water pistol and everything! It&#39;ll just take me a minute to get it. Calvin: Ok, you can play.  But Hobbes is on my team. You have to fight both of us. Susie: Great! I can beat you and your stuffed tiger any day. I&#39;ll go put on my swimsuit. Calvin: Susie&#39;s going to play with us, Ok? Hobbes: Oh boy. Girls flip for guys in jams.

I&#39;m all set! calvin: Good. Now Hobbes and I will be one team, and you... Susie: Look at your toy tiger! He&#39;s wearing jams! That&#39;s so cute! Let me squeeze him! Calvin: Oh for Pete&#39;s sake, knock it off! You go around the house and count to fifty and then we begin, all right? You and your dumb jams. This is war, remember?! Hobbes: You&#39;re just jealous.  ...Ooh, what a babe!

Here&#39;s our strategy: I&#39;ll go around the house this way, and you go around the other way. I&#39;ll draw Susie&#39;s fire. And you can let her have it from behind with your water balloon! Got it? Oh, let&#39;s go! Susie: Thanks for the water balloon, Hobbes, you&#39;re a great double agent!

Anbush!! Have a drink, Susie! Whoa! Whoop! You&#39;ve got Hobbes&#39; water balloon! Where did...? How...? ..Uh oh... I promise you you&#39;ll hang for this, traitor! Hobbes: I&#39;m easily wiled by a woman in a swimsuit.

Susie drenched me with my own teammate&#39;s water balloon! Some buddy you are. You Benedict Arnold! Hobbes: Hmph, I&#39;d do it again in a minute. Susie likes my jams. Calvin: Don&#39;t even talk to me! You and I are through! Hobbes: Ha! Promises, promises! Susie: Um... I take it the game is over. Calvin: Get this traitor off me. He cheats when he fights, too.

Some idiot tossed garbage here in this beautiful spot.  I&#39;ll bet future civilzations find out more about us than we&#39;d like them to know.  Look, another can thrown on the ground!  Boy, this makes me mad!  By golly, if people aren&#39;t burning toxic wastes or testing nuclear weapons, they&#39;re throwing trash everywhere!  You&#39;d think planets like this were a dime a dozen!  Now, I&#39;ve got to carry this gross thing.  Hobbes:  You know, there are times when it&#39;s a source of personal pride to not be human.  Calvin:  I&#39;m with you.

No responsibilities at all! We have the whole day to ourselves. Don&#39;t you wish is could be like this all year, forever? No school. No job, no anything? Yeah, just gloat about it, why don&#39;t you!!
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|7|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/07/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2a290b70debb01317193005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin: Hey Dad, what are clouds made of? Dad: Hmm... I used to know that. I think they&#39;re mostly water. Calvin: So how come they float? Dad: Well, it&#39;s sort of ecaporated water. Maybe there are some other gases, too. I&#39;m not sure. Calvin: So why are they white when the rest of the sky is blue? Calvin: Heck, beats me. I guess we ought to look this stuff up. Calvin: I take it there&#39;s no qualifying exam to be a dad.

The gentle breeze blowing, the droning hum... Everything seems safe and serene when the fan is on. It&#39;s cool and lulling and perfect for sleep. It almost lets one forget he has a heavy fur coat for a bunkmate. Hobbes: If you don&#39;t like it, there&#39;s plenty of room on the floor, buster.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|7|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/07/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2cc64e90debb01317193005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin: Hey Mom, what&#39;s this I hear about the greenhouse effect? They say the pollutants we dump in the air are trapping in the sun&#39;s heat and it&#39;s going to melt the polar ice caps! Sure, you&#39;ll be gone when when it happens, but I won&#39;t! Nice planet you&#39;re leaving me! Mom: This from the kid who wants to be charffered any place more than a block away. Calvin; Hey. Noboldy told me about the ice caps, all right?

We&#39;re looking at an all-time low in popularity here. Dad: Well, Calvin, that&#39;s certainly food for thought. Now here&#39;s something you can think about. The average cost of raising a kid to age 18 is $100,000. That&#39;s a lot of money. So the question you should be asking yourself is. &quot;Is that hundred grand a gift...or a loan?&quot; Calvin: Gotcha, Dad. I was just on my way to bed.

Person on phone: May I speak to your father, please? Calvin: Heck, you don&#39;t need my permission! Be my guest! What a weirdo.

Hobbes:  Tigers are natural-born tree climbers.  Of course, we usually have grappling hooks, ropes and utility belts.  Calvin:  Hey, here&#39;s a great tree for climbing!  Let me get on your shoulders so I can reach the first branch, ok?  Hobbes:  Geez, how many bricks do you have in your pockets?!  Calvin:  Whoa!  Hold steady, you weakling!  I&#39;ve almost got it!  Move up, move up!  Hobbes:  Hurry and grab it before my spine telescopes.  Calvin:  Got it!...hey, don&#39;t let go!  Hold me up!  Hobbes:  Forget it!  You can support your own weight, bowling ball butt.  Calvin:  Mmph!  Mmph!  I can&#39;t get up!  Give me a boost!  Hey!  What are you doing?!  Don&#39;t take off my shoes!  Are you nuts?  Hey, stop!  Aack!  Oh no!  Don&#39;t tickle! Pbth! Eek! Hee hee ha ha!  Stop it!  I can&#39;t hold on!  Hobbes: Nice landing.  I&#39;m probably paralyzed.  Calvin:  All except your mouth, obviously.  I&#39;m not sorry at all.  Give me back my shoes.  Hobbes:  No.

It&#39;s so boring here. Nothing ever changes around here. Nothing ever happens. It seems as if (hang on) everybody but me gets to have an exciting life. Hobbes: Actually, I&#39;d like less excitement in my life. Calvin: Why? Are you doing fun things when I&#39;m not around?? Huh? Are you?!

Why are you still in bed? Calvin: I don&#39;t feel good. Mom: Your forehead seems warm. We&#39;d better take your temperature. Calvin: I can&#39;t be sick now! It&#39;s still summer vacation! There&#39;s no school to stay home from! This is my time! Somebody owes me big for this!!

I understand you&#39;re not feeling well. Calvin: Me? I&#39;m fine! I just sit around torture chambers in my underwear for kicks. Let&#39;s see your degree, you quack! Doctor: I&#39;m not going to hurt you. I&#39;m just going to examine you to see what&#39;s wrong. Calvin: I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s wrong! I&#39;ve got Dr. Frankenstein for a pediatrician, that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong! Doctor: Nurse, call the anesthesiologist in here, will you please? Calvin: My dad&#39;s a laywer, I&#39;ll have you know! Don&#39;t come near me!

A guard leads Spiff to the interrogation room. Our hero is stoic and defiamt! Zog King: At last I meet the famed Spaceman Spiff! I trust you are ...heh heh... enjoying your visit? Calvin: You&#39;re wasting your time, maggot from mars! I&#39;ll never give in! Never, you hear me?! Never! Doctor: Kid, don&#39;t make me recant the hippocratic oath, Ok?

Calvin: I fended him off with his own tongue depressor. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t get a shot. Mom: You didn&#39;t need a shot. Your behavior was inexcusable. Calvin: All that counts is that he couldn&#39;t get near enough stick me. He things I&#39;m a little pink pin cushion in underpants. Mom: Someday I hope you have a kid that puts you through what I&#39;ve gone through. Calvin: Yeah, grandma says that&#39;s what she used to tell you.

Can I make a suggestion?  Give up on that sissy lighter fluid.  Can&#39;t we cook the hamburgers yet?  Dad:  The coals aren&#39;t hot enough.  Calvin:  But I&#39;m hungry!  I want to eat now!  Dad:  Well, you&#39;ll just have to wait. You know, Calvin, sometimes the anticipation of something is more fun than the thing itself once you get it.  Here we are, it&#39;s a beautiful evening.  It&#39;s nice to just sit here and look at the trees while we wait for the coals to get hot, don&#39;t you think? Dinner will be over soon, and aferwards we&#39;ll be distracted with other things to do.  But now we have a few minutes to ourselves to enjoy the evening.  These summer days go by so quickly.  It&#39;s good that every now and then we have to wait for something.  Calvin: So should I go to McDonald&#39;s then or what?  Dad:  Yeah, I know. You think you&#39;re going to be six all your life.

Producing a series of loud, high pitched squeaks, the bat can judge an insect&#39;s distance and elevation by the time delay of the squeak&#39;s echo! Changes in the echo&#39;s pitch reveal the direction! No movement escapes the incredible senses of the bat! Glump! Ta-daa! Eyes closed!

Hobbes:  Yeah?  Prove it!  Calvin:  This isn&#39;t fair!  You can&#39;t run anywhere!  Hobbes:  Just watch me!  Calvin:  If we had a first baseman, you&#39;d &#39;ve been out long ago!

Hobbes: We&#39;re going to need a vacation after this vacation.  Calvin: I&#39;ll say! We can&#39;t even keep a fire going. I can&#39;t believe Dad went out to catch fish. Hobbes: In this weather?  He&#39;s a fanatic! Calvin: Either that, or we&#39;re all out of packaged food. We&#39;ll probably starve to death on this God-forsaken rock.

Put on your goggles and we&#39;ll be off to the future! Hobbes: Why do we have to wear goggles? Calvin Geez, do you think traveling years into the future is like driving down the street?! We&#39;ve got to contend with vortexes and light speeds! Anything could go wrong! Of course we need to wear goggles! Hobbes: Gosh, I think my goggles are in the bedroom. If I&#39;m not back in a couple minutes, you can go without me. Calvin: Sit down, sissy. I already got your goggles.

I&#39;ll just push the button and off we go into the future! Up, up and awaayyy! We&#39;re approaching light speed, Hobbes! Hang on! Hobbes: I have to go to the bathroom. Calvin: Now?! In hypersapce?! Are you crazy?!?

Calvin: It&#39;s hard to pinpoint exactly, but I&#39;d say sometime around the turn of the century. Hobbes: I hope &#39;ol Earth is still around then. I&#39;ve grown fond of it. Calvin: If not, we&#39;ll return to the present and see if Dad will give me my college tuition early in cash.

We&#39;re coming in! Wow! So this is the future! Hobbes: I kinda pictured more buildings. Calvin: Maybe we landed in an arboretum.

Hobbes:  While others of us face the prospect of never doing anything else. Calvin:  Oh, hush. We&#39;ll find our way home. Hobbes:  You don&#39;t remember this?  Calvin:  Nope, we&#39;re sure lost this time.  Hobbes:  If I had know we weren&#39;t going to find our way home, I&#39;d have brought my coloring book.  Calvin:  We could be here for months.  We&#39;d better forage for shelter.  This will be fun! We can be modern Robinson Crusoes, living off the land by our wits!  Hobbes:  We can be rugged explorers!  Calvin: Yeah!  We&#39;ll be free from all the constraints of civilization!  Oh boy!  Hobbes:  Hey, isn&#39;t that our back yard.  Calvin:  Why so it is.  Mom:  I don&#39;t care how long you&#39;ll be gone, I&#39;m only making you one sandwich.  Calvin:  How about rifles, then?  Do we have any rifles?

Hobbes: Look at this. Calvin: Gosh, I wonder what futuristic device this is! Some sort of transportation pod, I&#39;d guess. Hobbes: I wonder how you get in? Calvin: I don&#39;t see a door or license number anywhere. Calvin: This is very peculiar. Hobbes: Have you ever seen a tree this color?

Hobbes: This breeze is so hot and muggy. I figured they&#39;d be able to control the weather by now. Calvin: The air stinks, too. I guess there&#39;s still pollution. Ever feel as if you&#39;re being monitored? Hobbes: ...Or that you&#39;re about to do a double-take?

Back to the time machine! Run! We must&#39;ve gone back in time instead of forward! Hobbes: What tipped you off? The dinosaur?! Calvin: Don&#39;t get smart, fuzzbrain. Just get in and face the other direction so we go into the future this time! Calvin: You mean we went into the past because we were facing the wrong way?!? Calvin: You think I&#39;ve got some triple-A map? Maybe you&#39;d like to steer this time!

It&#39;s a good thing this time machine didn&#39;t stall, or we&#39;d have been eaten by dinosaurs! We&#39;re coming back toward the present now. Do you want to stop at home or keep going into the future like we planned? Hobbes: I&#39;ve had enough time traveling. Let&#39;s go home. Calvin: Let&#39;s go just a little into the future and see what I&quot;m like as a teen-ager! Hobbes: Let&#39;s not, all right?

Hobbes and I went time traveling and visited the jurassic period today. Mom: That&#39;s nice. What&#39;s it like. Calvin: Pretty scary. A dinosaur almost ate us. Actually, we were trying to go into the future, but we made a mistake. Mom: I see. Well, I&#39;m glad you made it back. Hobbes: Your mom isn&#39;t fazed by much, is she? Calvin: It depends. She didn&#39;t take the frogs in the toilet so well, remember?

The sun&#39;s setting and it&#39;s only 3 o&#39;clock! Dad: It&#39;s not 3 o&#39;clock. Your watch stopped. Calvin: Time doesn&#39;t stop ir your watch stops? Dad: Nope. Calvin: Phooey. For a moment there, I thought I&#39;d get rich patenting this thing. Dad: I&#39;d have bought one.

Well, Hobbes, how do I look?  Hobbes:  I&#39;m doing my best to bite my tongue.  Calvin:  I cut out construction paper feathers and taped them on my arms so I can fly!  Pretty neat, huh?  Hobbes:  If paper feathers are all it takes to fly, don&#39;t you think we&#39;d have heard about it before?  Calvin:  It takes an uncommon mind to think of these things, Hobbes.  Hobbes:  I&#39;d agree with that.  Calvin:  Here&#39;s a gorge.  This is a good spot.  Hobbes:  You&#39;re going to jump off this ledge?  Calvin:  Heck no!  I need momentum!  I want you to toss me over.  Hobbes:  You understand I assume no responsibility for this?  Calvin:  Right.  I get the patent.  Hobbes:  Heave!  Calvin:  I&#39;m flying!  I&#39;m flying!  I&#39;m...uh..oh...  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t sell the bike shop, Orville.  Calvin:  Shut up and go get me some antiseptic.

This is the last straw! I don&#39;t have to put up with this totalitarianism! I&#39;m seceding! Hobbes: Gee, can you secede from your own family? Calvin: Why no?! I never signed up for this group! I wasn&#39;t even consulted! The only reason Mom and Dad are my parents is because I was born to them! Hobbes: A biological comspiracy, huh?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|9|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/09/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/6fa10c60debb01317193005056a9545d|328|900|Calvin: We can live anywhere we want to now that we&#39;re seceding from the family! Where do you want to go? The Sahara? Antarctica? Hobbes: How are we going to get to any of those places? We don&#39;t even have a car! Calvin: Ok, Dad, for this amazing trick, I&#39;ll need an ordinary American Express card. Now close your eyes...

Mom: Oh, really? Calvin: Yep. We&#39;re taking my sled and moving to the Yukon. Mom: Well, that&#39;s a long way away. Calvin: I know. Here&#39;s a list of sandwiches and supplies we&#39;ll need. Mom: Why should I do all this if you&#39;re seceding from the family? Calvin: We haven&#39;t seceded yet! Geez. What kind of mom are you?

Comic boocks, dart gun, space helmet and toboggan! We&#39;re off to the yukon! Hobbes: Do we have a map? Calvin: Ooh, that&#39;s right! Glad you remembered! I&#39;ll go get one! Don&#39;t we have any road maps of the Yukon, Mom? Mom: I doubt it. Calvin: Ok, here&#39;s the Yukon. Now see if you can find the United States. Hobbes: Here they are! Look how close it is! This won&#39;t take any time at all!

We&#39;re off to the Yukon. It&#39;s been nice living here... but not real nice! Ha ha. Mom: Calvin! Wait a minute. Calvin: Leave it to a mother to drag out a goodbye, sheesh. Mom: You&#39;re going southeast. North is that way. Calvin: Oh yeah. I knew that.

I thought we were going to ride it most of the way to the Yukon. Calvin: We&#39;ve only been walking 20 minutes, Hobbes. We probably won&#39;t get to northern Canada until this afternoon. Hobbes: In that case, I&#39;m taking a break. Calvin: Good idea. Want a comic book? Here&#39;s Captain Nitro. Hobbes: I want a sandwich. Calvin: We just have one apice. We should save &#39;em in case we can&#39;t catch a walrus.

Calvin:  Relax, Hobbes, these sandwiches will give us energy to spare.  Hobbes:  Mmff, whath thith?  Honey &quot;n&quot; marthmallowth?  Calvin:  That one is.  The other was chocolate syrup.  As long as we&#39;re taking a break, we might as well record our progress in the log.  &quot;Journey to the Yukon: Day one. Have traveled twenty minutes.  No snow so far.  Hobbes:  &quot;Food Supplies low.&quot;  Calvin:  &quot;Nevertheless, morale is high as we push north.&quot;  Hobbes:  My morale would be a lot higher if you&#39;d carry the toboggan.  Calvin:  Me?!  I&#39;m the leader of this expedition!  I&#39;m forging the path!  Hobbes: I think it&#39;s my turn to be leader now.  Calvin:  You can&#39;t be the leader!  See, I&#39;ve got the commander hat.  Hobbes:  That can be easily remedied.  Calvin:  Hey! Leggo!  This is my helmet!  Hobbes:  Ow!  Quit biting!  Calvin:  This is mutiny!  Give that back!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m the captain now.  I give the commands.  First, I decree double rations for all officers to aid their decision-making capabilities.  Calvin:  Oh no you don&#39;t!....That last sandwich is mine!

I&#39;m the rightful captain! You jsut stole my captain helmet! Hobbes: Let&#39;s say you gave it to me under extreme duress. Calvin: Ooh, if you were littler than me, boy, I&#39;d pound you! Hobbes: Ha! Your mom told me you have a weird diesase and you&#39;re going to get smaller as you grow older! Calvin: She did not! That&#39;s not true! Hobbes: In fact, she&#39;s already got a contract from the circus side show. I saw it myself. Calvin: I&#39;m not listening! I&#39;m not listening! Ohh, say can you seee...

I&#39;m not going at all! You can go to the Yukon yourself. Hobbes: Ha! As captain, I fire you anyway! Calvin: Good! I&#39;m going home! Hobbes: You don&#39;t have a home. You seceded, remember? Calvin: My life meeds a rewind/erase button. Hobbes: ...And a volume control.

What if they tell me I can&#39;t rejoin the family? Calvin: They have to take me back! I&#39;m their stupid kid, right? Right! ...The operative word being &quot;stupid.&quot;

Maybe they rented out my room. Maybe they moved! ...A lot can happen when you&#39;re gone all morning! ...Mommmm!!

I changed my mind about seceding. I want to be your kid again, Ok? Mom: You&#39;ll always be my kid. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. Calvin: Well, Hobbes was being a moron, so I decided I didn&#39;t want to live in the Yukon with him. Mom: So where is Hobbes now? Calvin: Isn&#39;t he back yet? Mom: How could Hobbes get back by himself? Calvin: You&#39;re right. That dumb tigeer couldn&#39;t find his way out of an empty room.

Calvin: Where&#39;s Hobbes? Mom: I suppose he&#39;s wherever you left him. Calvin: You mean he&#39;s still in the woods?? It&#39;s night out! Mom: What have I told you about leaving your belongings? Calvin: Hobbes is lost! I&#39;ll get a flashlight! We&#39;ve got to find him! Hobbes! Hobbes! Mom: Calvin, it&#39;s your bedtime! Don&#39;t you pull this stunt now!

I didn&#39;t mean that quite the way that sounded.  Mom:  C&#39;mon, Calvin, get back inside.  It&#39;s too late to go searching for your stuffed tiger now.  Calvin:  I can&#39;t leave Hobbes alone in the woods at night!  Mom:  Well, maybe you should have thought about that before it got dark.  This can be a little lesson, hmm?  Calvin:  I thought he&#39;d come back by himself.  I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d get lost!  Mom: We&#39;ll look for him tomorrow!  Now off to bed with you.  Calvin:  (Sniff) I hope we&#39;s ok.  If he hadn&#39;t been acting so stupid I never would&#39;ve left him.  Calvin:  I sure wish he&#39;d come back.  Mom:  Calvin left Hobbes somewhere in the woods.  The poor kid&#39;s pretty upset.  Dad:  I&#39;ll bet.  Mom:  I mean he&#39;s really upset.  Dad:  I said I&#39;ll bet he is.  Mom: Really upset.  Dad:  Ahh....   Would my Dad have done this?  Of course not.  I was never spoiled like this....

Dad: Of course not! How am I going to find a stuffed tiger in the woods at night?! Why can&#39;t Calvin keep track of his toys?! I myst be crazy to be out here. Mom: Ho-o-obbes! Oops. Heh heh.

He&#39;d better be, or tomorrow I&#39;ll leave him in the woods. Mom: C&#39;mon we&#39;ll put Hobbes in Calvin&#39;s bed so he&#39;ll see him first thing tomorrow. Mom: He snuggled up in his sleep! What a little angel! Calvin: Z Dad: Only at night. I&#39;m going to bed.

You&#39;re back! I&#39;m so glad to see you! Hobbes: I&#39;m glad to see you, too. Calvin: Gose, weren&#39;t you scared being out in the woods at night? Hobbes: Heck no. Tigers aren&#39;t scared of that! I got so bored I hiked back. Calvin: Mom! Look! Hobbes is back! Mom: Yes, your dad found him last night and brought him in. Calvin: Is that so-o-o?! Mom: Mm-hmm. Why don&#39;t you go thank him right now?

I brought Mr. Bun over so wer can play house. You and I can be the parents, and Hobbes and Mr. Bun can be our children. Calvin: Oh, right. Hobbes and I are gonna put our big plans on hold so we can play house with a stuffed rabbit? Forget it! Susie: I don&#39;t see why you&#39;ll play with your dumb ol&#39; tiger and now with Mr. Bun and me! You&#39;re jsut mean, that&#39;s all! Calvin: Go play in a microwave, Susie. We&#39;re busy. Girls are like slugs - they probably serve some purpose, but it&#39;s hard to imagine what. Hobbes: Mr. Bun seem comatose. Did you notice?

It happened again. Calvin waked up without any recognizable features, save two antennae. How disgusting. He oozes out of bed on a trail of slime.

Calvin: Can I come too? Mom: No. You&#39;re staying home. Calvin: What, I got the plague?! Why can&#39;t I come?

Hobbes: Can we watch TV? Calvin: What Mom and Dad don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt &#39;em, right? In fact, after they leave, let&#39;s get in the other car and learn to drive! Hobbes: Oh boy! I get to beep the horn, Ok? Hey, there&#39;s a teen-ager coming up the drive. Oh no! It&#39;s Rosalyn! Calvin: Our babysitter?! What&#39;s she doing here? Don&#39;t Mom and Dad trust us??

Well, a tidy little domestic scene. A house in a yard with flowers. How typically female. Calvin: Girls think small and are preoccupied with petty detalis. But boys think big! Boys think about action and accomplishment! No wonder it&#39;s men who change the world! Susie: Yeah? What did you draw? Calvin: A squadron of B-Is nuking New York.

Zorg Despot:  So this is the famed space explorer Spiff!  I&#39;be waited a long time for this moment, earthling scum!    You have knowledge we need. Cooperate and we&#39;ll kill you rather painlessly.  Calvin:  Let&#39;s dispense with the pleasantries, you twisted space crustacean.  What is it you want from me?  Zorg:  A summary of Lewis and Clark&#39;s expedition to the pacific!  Miss Wormwood:  You didn&#39;t read the assignment, did you Calvin?  Calvin: Ha!  Wild Zontars couldn&#39;t drag that information out of me!  Do your worst!

Calvin: I am. Moe keeps knocking me down at school for no reason. He&#39;s mean just for kicks. I sure am glad you&#39;re an animal. Animals sometimes make a lot more sense than people do. Hobbes: ...And we&#39;re cuter too. Calvin: Right, Hobbes. Good point.

You don&#39;t need to kill him or anything. Just give &#39;im something to think about on the way to surgery. He usually comes after me at recess, so we&#39;ll get him then. Hey, you don&#39;t have rabies, do you? Hobbes: Certainly not. Calvin: Rats. Well, I suppose he&#39;d at least have to get a tetnus shot.

It&#39;s not a show and tell day. Calvin: I know. Hobbes is going to give Moe a little &quot;treat&quot; today: A ride in an ambulance helicopter. Susie: Yeah? How&#39;s he going to do that? Calvin: If you ahve an aversion to descriptions of carnage, you probably don&#39;t want to know. Susie: Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out-of-body experience. Calvin: Don&#39;t get too close now. I want Hobbes to stay fresh for this afternoon.

That&#39;s real sweet, Cal. Calvin: It&#39;s a tiger you brainless invertebrate. Moe: Hey, maybe I&#39;d like to play with your teddy. Calvin: Good idea, Moe, Hobbes plays kinda rough, but he&#39;s lots of fun. C&#39;mere and take him. Moe: Why? Is the teacher watching? This is a trick, right? I&#39;m not touching your stupid teddy, see? Calvin: C&#39;mon, I dare you! What&#39;s the matter? Are you chicken? Ha ha! Boy, you sure scared him off! You were great! Hobbes: Come back and call me a &quot;bear&quot; again! Yeah, you, bub!!

Calvin: I&#39;m afraid you wasted your time, Mom. Moe took one look at Hobbes and just about lost his lunch. I don&#39;t think Moe will be bothering me for a while. It&#39;s not every kid who has a tiger for a best friend. Mom: ...And what lucky moms those other kids have. Calvin: C&#39;mon Hobbes. if you&#39;ll lend me a buck I&#39;ll buy you a comic book.

Any day you have to take a bath and go to bed early isn&#39;t a day off in my book.  Autumn Sundays are the worst.  You can never really enjoy Sundays because in the back of your mind you know you have to go to school the next day.  And when the leaves change color, it just reminds you even more that summer&#39;s over and school&#39;s just begun.  Hobbes:  Gee, I like this season best of all!  The trees are like nature&#39;s own firewords display!  I love the brisk air, the early evenings, the uh...the...yes, well...hmm... Kapow!  Fwoosh!  Zingg!  Calvin:  You didn&#39;t mention fresh applesauce, fuzzhead.  Do you like applesauce??

What are these little specs anyway? Lizard parts? Who knows? And this &#39;skin.&#39; I heard it used to be made out of intestine, but I think nowadays it&#39;s plastic. Of course, they dye and wax fruit so it looks better. It&#39;s like eating a candle. Susie: And Mom wonders why I&#39;m so hungry after school. Calvin: Yep, we&#39;d probably be dead now if it wasn&#39;t for twinkies.

Calvin: I got some Raid!  Lift up the mattress!  Hobbes:  Let him have it!  Calvin:  Gosh, all that spray didn&#39;t kill him!  What are we gonna do?!  Hobbes:  I hear your Dad coming!

Nobody cares about your positions on fatherhood, we just want to know about your character. Calvin: If you&#39;re going to be Dad here, we have to konw you&#39;ve never done or said anything that would reflect poorly on your judgement. I have your college yearbook here.

He says comics now are just a bunch of xeroxed talking heads because there&#39;s no space to tell a decent story or to show any action. He thinks people should write to their newspapers and complain. Hobbes: Your grandpa takes the funnies pretty seriously. Calvin: Yeah, Mom&#39;s looking into nursing homes.

This TV star made over twenty million dollars last year! What would you do with twenty million bucks? Hobbes: Beats me. I think it&#39;s rediculous that anyone makes that kind of money. Calvin: Ok.

He says it&#39;s colder because the earth&#39;s orbit is taking us farther from the sun. He says winter will be here woon. Isn&#39;t it sad how some peoples grip on their lives is so precarious that they&#39;ll embrace any preposterous delusion rather than face an occasional bleak truth?

It doesn&#39;t have any romance in it, does it? Dad: Uh... Calvin: Edit it out if it does. I hate romance. Does it have any boring description in it? Dad: Well... Calvin: Skip it if you see any. I like my stories fast and gripping. It doesn&#39;t have a moral. Does it? I hate being told how to live my life. Skip the moral, too, ok? Dad: Does his majesty prefer color pictures, or black and white?

The Great Calvini can escape from anything! Parent: Calvin, dinner time! Hobbes: Should I tell her you&#39;re tied up at the moment, ha ha? Calvin: I&#39;ll be (mmf) out of here (rrg) in no time.

Calvin: I&#39;ll be down in a second. Hobbes: You wan me to help untie you? Calvin: No! Don&#39;t touch those ropes! I want to escape! It&#39;s easy. I just loosen the knots. No ropes can hold me! Whoop! Ow!! Hobbes: Good thing you&#39;re doing this here before you tried it under water.

Calvin: Ok, ok, just read about knots, all right? Hobbes: Hey, look, here&#39;s a motto! I didn&#39;t know you had a motto! Wow, what fun! Calvin: &quot;Live for revenge&quot; is going to be my motto if you don&#39;t get me out of this. Hobbes: I&#39;ll quiz you. What do you do for a second degree burn? Calvin: Don&#39;t flip throught the book, you idiot! Untie me! Hobbes: Hmph, if I was in your predicament, I&#39;d treat me with a lot more respect. Do you say you&#39;re sorry? Calvin: Mmff! Rrggh!

Calvin, the mighty god, creates the universe with pure will!  From utter nothingness comes swirling form!  Life begins where once was void!  But Calvin is no kind and loving god!  He&#39;s one of the old gods!  He demands sacrifice!  Yes, Calvin is a god of the underworld!  And the puny inhabitants of earth displease him!

Here it... Hey! You&#39;re peeking! What&#39;s the matter? Don&#39;t you trust your own kid?! C&#39;mon, close your eyes! Uh oh. Hang on. He got away.

Last year I did not receive several items from my list. For your convenience, I have grouped those items together on page 12. Please check them carefully, and include them with the rest of my loot this year. Calvin: That&#39;s the problem with this guy. He&#39;s gotten sloppy without any competition.

He knows if you&#39;ve been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake! Calvin: Santa Claus: Kindly old elf, or CIA spook?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/dcf574c0debb01317193005056a9545d|301|900|Cavlin: This Santa Claus stuff bothers me...especially the judge and jury bit. Who appointed Santa? How do we know he&#39;s impartial? What criteria does he use for determining good and bad? And what about extenuating circumstances? Kids should have the benefit of legal counsel, don&#39;t you think? Hobbes: You&#39;re worried about the salamander incident, aren you? Calvin: Temporary insanity! That&#39;s all it was!
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/de5d3ee0debb01317193005056a9545d|293|900|Calvin: They say Santat knows if you&#39;ve been good or bad, but what if someone had been sort of both? I mean, suppose some kid tried to be good...at least, well, most of the time...but bad things inexplicably kept happening? Suppose some kid just had terrible luck, and he got blamed for a lot of things he did only sort of on purpose? Hobbes: Who exactly might we be talking about? Calvin: This is a purely hypothetical case, Mr. Smartypants.

Can we?  Mom:  I don&#39;t know, Calvin.  It&#39;s awfully expensive.  Calvin:  Yeah, but just think how much loot would fit under it!  Dad!  Come bring the Christmas tree Mom and I picked!  It&#39;s a great one!  Dad:  This year I thought we&#39;d just keep the tree in the garage.  Calvin:  In the garage?!  Dad:  Sure, you can go out and look at it any time you like, and it saves all the trouble of decorating it.  Calvin:  We&#39;re not going to decorate it?!!!  Dad:  Why bother?  We just take it all down in two weeks on Christmas day.  If you get a present....  Calvin:  If I get a present?!  Dad:  You can take it out to the garage to open, and pretend the tree has lots of lights and.....  Calvin:  Mommmm!  Mom: I know somebody who&#39;s going to get a lot of coal in his stocking, buster.  Dad:  This season gets less jolly every year..

Why all the secrect? Why all the mystert? If the guy exists, why doesn&#39;t he ever show himself and prove it? And if he doesn&#39;t exist, what&#39;s the meaning of all this? Hobbes: I dunno... Isn&#39;t this a religious holiday? Calvin: Yeah, but actually, I&#39;ve got the same questions about God.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e1303450debb01317193005056a9545d|297|900|Calvin: Gosh, Hobbes, what if I don&#39;t get any presents this year because I doubted the existence of Santa? Suppose he&#39;s putting my name on the &quot;bad&quot; list right now! That would be awful! Personally, I&#39;d think that if you weren&#39;t on the &quot;bad&quot; list all along, this wouldn&#39;t push you over. Calvin: Thanks for the comfort eggnog brain. Hobbes: See? See why you&#39;re on the &quot;bad&quot; list? Insults!
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e29d01c0debb01317193005056a9545d|303|900|Calvin: Well, I&#39;ve decided I do believe in Santa Claus, no matter how preposterous he sounds. Hobbes: What convinced you? Calvin: A simple risk analysis. I want presents, lots of presents. Why risk not getting them over a matter of belief? Heck, I&#39;ll beleive anything they want. Hobbes: How cynically enterprising of you. Calvin: It&#39;s the spirit of Christmas.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e402fd90debb01317193005056a9545d|301|900|Calvin: Psst! Are you awake? Hobbes: Of course. Calvin: I haven&#39;t heard Santa yet, have you? Do you think he&#39;s coming? Hobbes: It&#39;s only 11:00, we may be on the later route. Calvin: *gasp* Did you hear that? Hobbes: It&#39;s him! It&#39;s Santa! Shhh! He&#39;s saying something! Dad: Slppin&#39; rippin&#39; dang fang rotten zarg barg-a-ding dong! Mom: Quiet, dear! Calvin will hear you!

Mom: Come on, let&#39;s just get it over with this time, all right? Where are you? Let&#39;s go! Calvin: She&#39;ll never look here.

I need some illustrations for a story I&#39;m writing.  You can draw something besides tigers, can&#39;t you?  Hobbes:  Sure, leopards, pumas, ocelots..you name it. Calvin:  Here Dad, read this story tonight.  I wrote it and Hobbes illustrated it.  Dad:  Um...ok..  &quot;The Dad Who Lived To Regret Being Mean To His Kid.&quot;  Calvin:  What are you pausing for?  Keep reading.  Calvin&#39;s story:  Barney&#39;s Dad was really bad, so Barney hatched a plan.  When his Dad said, &quot;Eat your peas!&quot;  Barney shouted, &quot;No!&quot; and ran.  Barney tricked his mean ol&#39; Dad and locked him in the cellar.  His Mom never found out where he&#39;d gone, &#39;cause Barney didn&#39;t tell her.  There his Dad spent his life, eating mice and gruel.  With every bite for fifty years he was sorry he&#39;d been cruel.  The End.  Calvin:  You know how a lot of stories have morals to them..?  Dad:  I get it!  I get it!

Is is money. cars and women? ...Or is it just money and cars? Well-l-l-l?

You call this snow?! It&#39;s not even an inch high! What good is less than an inch of snow?! Hobbes: Well, it&#39;s pretty. Calvin: Nobody ever closed a school on account of prettiness.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/eaef7c60debb01317193005056a9545d|299|900|Calvin: This will be the strongest snowfort ever made! Keep packing on snow. This will be indestructible. We&#39;ll pour water on it, so it freezes overnight. That way our fort will be here until July! Dad: Where&#39;s that kid?!
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1987|12|31|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/12/31|https://assets.amuniversal.com/ec59fb60debb01317193005056a9545d|304|900|Calvin: This snow fort can repel any attack! I hate this neighborhood.

Hobbes: It&#39;s handy not to have boots and a coat to take off.

From behind its thick wall, I can launch a brutal snowball barrage and remain safe from retaliation. You&#39;re supposed to attack from that side of the fort, dummy!!
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|1|3|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/01/03|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2d6a60b0dec7013171a3005056a9545d|633|900|Hobbes:  Did you make any resolutions for the New Year?  Calvin:  Heck no.  I&#39;m fine just the way I am!  Why should I change?  In fact, I think it&#39;s high time the world started changing to suit me!  I don&#39;t see why I should do all the changing around here!  If the New Year requires resolutions, I say it&#39;s up to everyone else, not me!  I don&#39;t need to improve!  Everyone else does!  How about you?  Did you make any resolutions?  Hobbes:  Well, I had resolved to be less offended by human nature, but I think I blew it already.

Blustery cold days should be spent propped up in bed with a mug of hot chocolate and a pile of comic books. That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to be doing right now. As soom as I graduate, I&#39;m going to spend every winter that way. Hobbes: I wish your bus would come. My hot chocolate will get cold.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|1|5|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/01/05|https://assets.amuniversal.com/988c9740dec10131719a005056a9545d|299|900|Calvin: Help me figure out this homework problem, Hobbes. What&#39;s 3+8? Hobbes: Ok. Assign the answer a value of &quot;X.&quot; &quot;X&quot; always mean multiply so take the numerator (that&#39;s latin for &quot;number eighter&quot;) and put that on the other side of the equation. That leaves you with three on this side, so what tiems three equals eight? The answer, of course, is six. Calvin: Gosh, I must have done the others all wrong. Hobbes: These problems seem awfully advanced for first grade, if you ask me.

What&#39;s 9+4? Hobbes: Ooh, that&#39;s a tricky one. You have to use calculus and imaginary numbers for this. Calvin: Imaginary numbers?! Hobbes: You know eleventeen, thirty-twelve, and all those little confusing at first. Calvin: How did you learn all this? You&#39;ve never even gone to school! Hobbes: Instinct. Tigers are born with it.

Somebody crank up the thermostat! Why doesn&#39;t someone make a fire?! If we can&#39;t afford to heat this place, maybe Dad should get a better job! Why can&#39;t we move to Florida?! Parent: Calvin, pipe down and put on a sweater if you&#39;re cold. Calvin: And go to all that trouble?!

Mom says she doesn&#39;t watch TV at all while I&#39;m at school. ...So ir I get home at 3:00, I should be able to watch it straight till 10:30, right? Dad: Wrong. Calvin: Do you want us to be sub-average?!

Mom: Ok. Calvin: Aren&#39;t you going to put the wash in the dryer? Mom: In a minute. Calvin: You mean you&#39;re just going to let it sit in the washing machine?!? Mom: Calvin, can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy right now?! Clavin: She says she&#39;s busy. Hobbes: I hope the next time she takes a bath there aren&#39;t any towels.

Oh boy, here comes Susie!  Hey, Susie!  Whap!  Ha ha!  I gotch, you dumb girl!!  Susie:  Aughh!  My eyeball!! Where&#39;s my eyeball?!  Calvin:  What are you talking about?  I hit you in the back.  Susie:  It knocked my eyeball out!  Find it and pack it in snow so they can save it! Ow! Ow!  Calvin:  Gosh, did you really lose your eyeball?  I didnt&#39; know they came out!  Wow.  I&#39;m really sorry.  I didn&#39;t mean to knock it out.  Can I see the socket?  Boy, where do you suppose it rolled?  Susie:  Somewhere over there, poop head!!  Hobbes:  What are you doing?  Calvin:  My eyeball fell out, help me look for it.

Mom: Your Uncle Max. I thought I told you. Calvin: Uncle Max?? I don&#39;t remember any Uncle Max. Are you sure he&#39;s related? Maybe he&#39;s a con man trying to swindle us! Mom: Of course he&#39;s related. He&#39;s your dad&#39;s brother. He just hasn&#39;t been here for a few years. Calvin:Why not? Was he in jail? Mom: No! Good heavens, Calvin. Dad: Now, now... with Max, that&#39;s not a bad guess.

Dad: How come you&#39;re so quiet back there? Aren&#39;t you excited to see Uncle Max? Calvin: ...Yeah...  I just hope nobody thinks I&#39;m giving up my room while he&#39;s here.

It seems like ages since you&#39;ve been here. Max: I&#39;ll say. I didn&#39;t think it had been so long, until I saw Calvin. This guy has really grown. So kid, what do you say? Calvin: I say you&#39;d better watch your step, &#39;cause I&#39;ve got a live man-eating tiger at home and if I so much as wink, he&#39;ll rip your legs right out. Max: Cute kid, bro.

I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re sleeping, but it sure isn&#39;t here. Max: Gotcha. Nice room. Calvin: This is Hobbes. I wouldn&#39;t get too close if I was you. Max: Don&#39;t worry. He looks like a fierce one. Calvin: Yep. Mandibles of death. That&#39;s what he&#39;s got. Max: ...And a killer&#39;s eye. You can tell. I...I think I&#39;ll go downstairs. Calvin: Ol&#39; Uncle Max seems pretty sharp. Hard to believe he&#39;s related to Dad. Hobbes: &quot;A killer&#39;s eye,&quot; he said! Wow! I wonder which one!

Hey, kid. What are you doing?! Calvin: I&#39;m going through your luggage. What&#39;s it look like I&#39;m doing? Max: Did Mommy and Daddy raise you themselves, or did they just untie you for my visit? Calvin: Didn&#39;t you bring me a present? I can&#39;t find one anywhere.

Can&#39;t I sit over there? I want to sit next to Uncle Max. Can I? Please? Please? Mom: Ok, go ahead. Move your chair over. Mom: You should be flattered, Max. Calvin asked to sit by you tonight. Max: Hey, that&#39;s sweet.

Another five minutes out here and I&#39;ll be frozen solid.  Gosh, I hope that was no one I knew. Mom:  You looked pretty cold coming up the hill, so I fixed you some hot chocolate and crackers with peanut butter.  Go wrap up in a blanket and take these in front of the fire.  Here&#39;s Hobbes and a comic book.  Getting toasty?  Calvin:  Uh huh.  Thanks.  She even put marshmallows in the hot chocolate.  Nobody knows how to pamper like a mom.  Hobbes:  So are you going to eat all those peanut butter crackers yourself or what?

Max: Me? Nope, I&#39;m not even married. Calvin: Oh. ...What difference does that make? Max: Kid watches a lot of TV, does he?

Mom: Yeah, they&#39;re inseparable. Max: Do you worry about that? I mean, shouldn&#39;t he be playing with real friends? Mom: Oh, I think he will when he&#39;s ready. Didn&#39;t you ever have an imaginary friend? Max: Sometimes I think all my friends have been imaginary.

I&#39;ll show you a magic disappearing trick! Ok, first I&#39;ll need an ordinary twenty-dollar bill. Max: How about if I lend you a nickel instead? Calvin: No, it works much better with a twenty. ...Or a fifty if you have one. Max: I take it you think your ol&#39; Uncle Max is a low-watt bulb. Calvin: Why, did Dad tell you how this works?

Max: Tomorrow. Is that soon enough? Calvin: Gee, I wish you could stay forever. Max: What a nice thing to say! You&#39;re all right, Calvin. Calvin: Mom&#39;s a lot more patient with me in front of guests.

It was great to see you again. Max: You, too. Mom: Have a safe trip home. Max: Come visit me sometime, ok, fella? Calvin: Heck, I&#39;ll come right now! So long, Mom! Bye, Dad! Dad: Calvin, get back here! Calvin: I never get to do anything fun. Dad: Missed your chance dear. We could&#39;ve bought him a ticket. Mom: Well...

Hobbes:  That&#39;s my square!  Ha ha!  You owe me money!  Calvin:  ..uh..eleven!  Hobbes:  Just a minute!  What are you doing??  You can&#39;t just take money from the bank! Calvin:  You&#39;ve got hotels on every piece of property you own.  I can&#39;t afford to pay you, so I&#39;m sticking up the bank.  It&#39;s a robbery!  Hobbes:  You can&#39;t do that!  Calvin:  I&#39;m the banker, right?  Am I going to risk my life over a few thousand dollars?  Hobbes:  The rules don&#39;t say you can rob the bank.  That&#39;s cheating.  Calvin:  Do the rules say you can&#39;t rob the bank?  Huh?  Do they? Just roll the dice and accept this as a tragic turn of events, ok?  Hobbes:  Ok, if that&#39;s how we&#39;re playing, then I&#39;m robbing you!  Calvin:  Ha!  I&#39;ll steal your deeds to Park Place and Boardwalk!  Hobbes:  Yeah? Well, I&#39;m taking all the houses and hotels and putting them on Baltic, where you just landed!  You owe me $250,000!  Calvin:  That&#39;s what you think, you- you....  Mom:  Isn&#39;t it cute how Calvin plays both sides of Monopoly with his stuffed tiger?  Dad:  I dunno...I overheard him using words he didn&#39;t learn in this household.

Susie: All I can say is you&#39;d better do a great job! I don&#39;t want to flunk just because I was assigned a doofus for a partner. Calvin: A doofus?? Who takes her sandwiches apart and eats each ingredient separately? Susie: What&#39;s wrong with that? Calvin: It certifies you as a grade &quot;A&quot; nimrod. Susie: It does not!

We&#39;ve got to do this dumb project together, so we might as well get it over with. What are we supposed to be doing? Susie: Weren&#39;t you even paying attention?! What would you do if I wasn&#39;t here to ask?? You&#39;d flunk and be sent bach to kindergarten, that&#39;s what! Calvin: Says you! I heard that sometimes kids don&#39;t pay attention because the class goes at too slow of a pace for them. Some of us are too smart for the class. Susie: Oh, right. You&#39;re too smart. Calvin: Belive it, lady. You know how Einstein got bad grades as a kid? Well, mine are even worse!

Susie: We&#39;re supposed to be researching the planet Mercury. Calvin: So what have we found out? Susie: Nothing! I&#39;m not going to do this whole thing by myself! Calvin: You&#39;d probably goof it all up if you did. Let&#39;s get started. Susie: Yes! Let&#39;s! Calvin: I&#39;ll be the management, and you can be the labor. First, get some books. Susie: Does anyone watn to trade partners?

You&#39;re doodling! You&#39;re sitting here drawing martians when we&#39;re supposed to be researching! You haven&#39;t done anything yet! Don&#39;t you care?? What&#39;s the matter with you?! It&#39;s no use! We&#39;re going to flunk! I&#39;ll have to go to a second-rate college because my idiot partner spent the study period drawing martians! Why me? Why me? Why me? Calvin: Here. This will cheer you up. The martian moves when you flip the pages! Watch, you can see him eat an astromaut!

We have to give our report on Monday. You&#39;d better bust your butt ober the weekend, or I&#39;m telling the teacher you didn&#39;t do any work. Got it? ...Well, what do you say?! An I getting through to you?? This is important! Gronk! Gribble gok! Gak gork! Goonk!! Calvin: Our hero regards the strange alien. ...It seems to be trying to communicate.

But aside from that, it&#39;s not much like earth.  We find Spaaceman Spiff struggling across the terrain of a distant planet!  Suddenly the ground begins to shake!  A cloud of dust appears on the horizon!  It&#39;s a Zorg!!  Our hero runs for cover, but the Zorg is instantly upon him!  Spiff fires his blaster but the weapon is useless against the monster!  The fearless space explorer is taken to the Zorg&#39;s cave, where he discovers a vat of boiling water!  Oh no!  Our hero is about to be cooked alive!  Spiff&#39;s mind races furiously...  Mom:  Well?  Get in.  Calvin:  Don&#39;t you want to lean way, way over and test how hot the water is?

Did you do your half? Calvin: Of course I did. And I&#39;ll bet my half makes your half look pathetic. Susie: It had better be good...or else! Clavin (writing): The Planet Mercurt: An exhaustively researched report by Calvin.

Calvin: Thank you, thank you! Hey, what a crowd! You look great this morning...really, I mean that! Go on, give yourselves a hand! You know. A funny thing happened on the way to the library yesterday... Susie: This isn&#39;t my fault, Miss Wormwood!

Mercury was the god of flowers and boquets, which is why today he is a registered trademark of FTD florists. Why they named a planet after this guy, I can&#39;t imagine. ...Um...back to you Susie.

I&#39;ve never seen Susie so mad. She accused me of not doing any research and claimed I made up the whole thing. Hobbes: Did you? Calvin: Heck, no. I just took a few creative liberties. Hobbes: And they callled your mom over a few creative liberties? Calvin: Geez, you think Susie was mad...

Risking life and limb! Looking death straight in the eye! &quot;Why?&quot; you ask! Why do we di it?? Hobbes: Because we get paid, I hope. Calvin: Because it&#39;s there!

Pretty scary, huh?  I&#39;ll bet you didn&#39;t know there were dinosaurs in this neighborhood! Susie:   Especially not dinosaurs with size 5, treaded toes.

Hobbes: A water pistol? Calvin: Heck, no! This is the new improved version of the transmogrifier. Now you can transmogrify things just by pointing at them! Say you don&#39;t like the color of your bedspread. Well, you just zap it, and presto. It&#39;s an iguana! Hobbes: One can certainly imagine the myriad of uses for a hand-held iguana maker. Calvin: It doesn&#39;t have to be an iguana. It can be anything. Suppose Mom&#39;s getting on our nerves for instance...

Calvin: Telepathy. The gun automatically reads the brain waves you emit, and turns the object into whatever you want. Hobbes: That&#39;s amazing. Calvin: Well, it took me all morning to invent. Hobbes: So say I&#39;m thinking about a big slab of grilled tuna now... Calvin: Watch were you&#39;re pointing that! Watch where you&#39;re pointing that!

I want to be a pterodactyl, so you think of one and point the transmogrifier at me. This will be great. I&#39;ll terrorize the neighborhood awhile and then you can transmogrity me back to a boy when the national guard comes. Hobbes: What&#39;s a pterodactyl? Some kind of bug? Calvin: No no! It&#39;s a big flying dinosaur! Don&#39;t shoot if you don&#39;t know what it is!!

You transmogrified me into a chicken!! You were supposed to turn me into a pterodactyl, you nincompoop!! All you had to do was think of a pterodactyl! Why did you think of a chicken?!? It&#39;s almost lunchtime. Calvin: Oh, I see. Well I&#39;m glad you weren&#39;t hungry for a hotdog!

Now try again, and do it right. I want to be a pterodactyl. Hobbes: Ok, here you go. Calvin: Well, now that&#39;s more like it! say, when did you turn yourself into a 200-foot-tall colossus? Calvin: I didn&#39;t. Why?

Hobbes: Big dinosaurs give me this willies. Calvin: You numbskull! How am I going to terrorize the neighborhood like this?! Hobbes: My, aren&#39;t ou the cranky one today? Calvin: By golly, I&#39;ll show you! Ha ha! Serves you right! Hobbes: You, my friend, just made a big mistake.

Now we&#39;re both transmogrified. We&#39;re even! Hobbes as duck: Even?? We would be even only if turning a tiger into a duck was an improvement. Calvin as pterodactyl: This wasn&#39;t at all what I had in mind when I asked you to transmogrify me into a pterodactyl. Pterodactyls are big! Hobbes as duck: So you turned me into a duck. Is that it? Calvin as pterodactyl:  Fair&#39;s fair. Hobbes as duck: Ok, I&#39;ll take the transmogrifer and fix you up right. Calvin as pig: Why you!! Gimme that gun! Hobbes as monkey: An insult! This is worse than before!! Calvin as owl: Great. Just great. Which of us is Calvin and which is Hobbes now? Hobbes as monster: Well, I hope Calvin is you, because his Mom&#39;s going to have a fit when she sees this.

Hobbes; Ok. Ahh, that&#39;s much better. Calvin: Now do me. What&#39;s wrong?? I&#39;m not transmogrifying! Hobbes: Boy, am I glad we did me first.

Why won&#39;t it work?? Hobbes: You invented it. You tell me. Calvin: Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m stuck as an owl for the rest of my life! Hobbes: I think owls mostly eat mice. I suppose we could catch some in the yard. Calvin: This is awful! What am I going to do?! Hobbes: Uggh, I could never ear a mouse raw. Their little feet are probably real cold going down. Calvin: Will you forget the stupid mice and help me think?!? Hobbes: I wonder if pet stores will sell you a mouse if they know you&#39;re going to eat it?

Mom: You don&#39;t look like a very happy owl. Calvin: Nope. I&quot;m not. Mom: Maybe some luch would help. Calvin: I doubt it. I don&#39;t like mice. Mom: This is soup. Calvin: Is it mouse soup. I don&#39;t like mice. Mom: I heard you. It&#39;s tomato.

I can&#39;t be an owl forever! How am I going to transmogrify back into a kid when the transmogrifier is broken? Hobbes: Maybe you should just learn to accept this predicament. It&#39;s not so bad being an owl instead of a kid. Actually, it&#39;s probably better. Calvin: Better?! How? Hobbes: Well, I never quite knew how to say this before, but little boys don&#39;t smell so good.

Why on earth don&#39;t you have any guns?? Dad: Your mom and I are going out. Rosalyn is here to babysit. Mom: Don&#39;t you remember? I told you that this morning. You just don&#39;t pay attention. That&#39;s why you never know what&#39;s going on. Calvin: How about a wooden stake and a mallet? Do we have that?!

Mom and dad asked Rosalyn to baby-sit us! There&#39;s just one thing to do. We&#39;ll mail ourselves to Australia. Climb in. Just put us out by the mailbox, Mom. Mom: Stop being sill, Calvin. Where&#39;s Rosalyn? I thought you said she was here. Calvin: As far as I know, whe&#39;s still on the front porch. Why? Mom: You didn&#39;t even let her in?!

I&#39;m sorry! We didn&#39;t realize Calvin hadn&#39;t let you in. Rosalyn: That&#39;s ok. It wasn&#39;t too cold and wet out. Mom: We&#39;re late. Help yourself to anything in the fridge. We&#39;ll see you at ten. Calvin: The door was jammed. Really. I couldn&#39;t get it open. Rosalyn: Bed.

Didn&#39;t Mom tell you Hobbes and I are on a strict big mac diet? It&#39;s doctor&#39;s orders! Rosalyn: Oh, I&#39;d better call your doctor then! Calvin: Oh, no, she called my bluff! The doctors gonna be furious! Boy, are we going to get it! Hobbes: &quot;We&quot;? Rosalyn: I&#39;m dialing! Helly, doctor? I&#39;m calling about Calvin&#39;s dietary needs. Voice on phone: ...At the tone, the time will be 6:27 and 10 seconds. *beep* Rosalyn: Bad news, Calvin. Your doctor says you should have a spoonful of castor oil and lie down all evening. Calvin: He did? Really? No, he didn&#39;t. Did he? What&#39;s castor oil?

Mom does it a lot better. This food smells funny. This isn&#39;t the way mom fixes it. I like it the way Mom does it better. Rosalyn: I&#39;m not your mom, all right?!? Calvin: No kidding! My mom loves me more than life itself, and she lets me do anything I want. Not like you, you nasty, ol&#39; barracuda. Rosalyn: I can&#39;t believe I postponed a date for this.

Calvin: We&#39;ve got to escape. Here&#39;s the plan: You start moaning, and when Rosalyn comes in, I&#39;ll throw this blanket over her. We&#39;ll tie her up and make our getaway, got it? Hobbes: Got it. Mrowryowowwrrr Calvin: Rosalyn, come quick! There&#39;s something wrong with Hobbes! Rosalyn: Right, Calvin. What should I do, call a vet? Calvin: No, just come up here and close your eyes.

That&#39;s when you ear the leftover milk that&#39;s all sludgy from the extra sugar you added. Sometimes I eat two or three bowls of this. Hobbes: I can hear your heart racing from here. Calvin: They make this cereal with marshmallow bits, too, but Mom won&#39;t buy it for me.

Somebody&#39;s always telling you what to do or what not to do. &quot;Do this!&quot; &quot;Stop that!&quot; Day after day. You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re a tiger. Hobbes: Well, we try to stay humble, but lord knows it&#39;s hard. Calvin: I wonder if I can grow fangs when my baby teeth fall out.

Hobbes: A common lament. Calvin: I&#39;ve got an idea! You can teach me to be a tiger! I&#39;ve got some red sleepers I can wear! Han on! See? We can make a tail by stuffing a knee sock and pinning it on my rear! Then you can draw stripes on my face! Hobbes: Hmm...what about fur and whiskers? Calvin: I haven&#39;t shaved for six years. I seem to be cursed with a thin beard.

Hobbes: Hold still while I draw stripes. Calvin: How do I look? Hobbes: It&#39;s some improvement. Calvin: Rowrrrrghghrawrr... Hobbes: I dunno, you&#39;re still lacking something tiger-ish. Panache. That&#39;s it. Calvin: Wait, I&#39;be got some plastic vampire fangs I can put in!

What&#39;s for dinner?&quot; ...How&#39;s that? Hobbes: Har har. Do you want me to teach you anything or not?

We&#39;re tigers. We&#39;re out in the wilderness, teach me how to survive. Let&#39;s say we&#39;re hiding up in a tree. Our keen tiger eyes and noses detect some prey nearby, what do we do? Hobbes: I suppose it would depend on what kind of prey it was. Calvin: I don&#39;t care, pick something. Hobbes: Well, if it&#39;s a box of rigatoni noodles, first you would go put on some water...

We&#39;ve been sitting in this dumb tree all morning, and you haven&#39;t taught me how to hunt or anything! Hobbes: It&#39;s instinct. You can&#39;t teach that. Calvin: Well, if you won&#39;t help, I&#39;ll just go look up &quot;tiger&quot; in the encyclopedia. Hobbes: As long as we&#39;re going in, let&#39;s fix some soup and sandwiches, OK?

Hobbes: It&#39;s true. Calvin: It is not, and if al your secrets are lies, you can just keep them to yourself. Hobbes: You just don&#39;t want to hear how little you went for. Calvin: Oh, hush up.

I guess we&#39;d better divide up the woods then. This will be my territory, and that will be yours. This rock will separate our two sides.

I know, I&#39;ll sneak around back and surprise him!  Heh heh!  There he is, all ready to pounce!  What a sucker!  I&#39;m home!  I&#39;be got to start listening to those quiet, nagging doubts.

Calvin: Ewww. It&#39;s got little spikes all over him. Tigers really eat these? Hobbes: By the truckload. They&#39;re great. Calvin: Let me see the book. Hobbes: Who are you going to believe. Some silly writer or a real tiger?

I tought we&#39;d be romping around the woods like we always do, but it turns out tigers don&#39;t whare their territories with other tigers! So here we are. Sitting on opposite sides of a big rock. What a blast. Being a tiger just isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be. Hobbes: That&#39;s no the half of it. It says here we&#39;re an endangered species!

We join our hero after a crash!  Landing on the hostile planet Mok.  Ominous figures appear on the horizon! The daring Spaceman Spiff lays waste with his death ray zorcher, but he is hopelessly outnumbered!  Surrounded, our hero is taken prisoner, and carried to a subterranean dungeon!  Monster:  Still won&#39;t talk, eh, Spiff?  We&#39;ll see about that!  Calvin:  You&#39;ll never get anything from me, space squid!  Monster:  You had your chance, Earthling!  Take him to the interrogation room and wash his hair!  Calvin:  Aaugh!  You got soap in my eyes on purpose!  Sinister Fiend!  Mom:  If you&#39;d stop thrashing around, maybe it wouldn&#39;t happen!

Thunder rumbles across the sky! Horribly, Calvin has been sewn together from corpses! A power surge forces blood to his brain! He&#39;s...he&#39;s alive! Dad: Well, look who&#39;s up and about. Mom: Hello, sleepyhead.

Seeing Calvin awake, the frog scrambles down and forces open Calvin&#39;s mouth! Calvin tries to fight, but the slippery amphibian instantly slides in and is swallowed! How disgusting! I don&#39;t feel good. Mom: You sound awful. You&#39;ve got a frog in your throat.

At five tons, he is the largest land mammal! His deafening call shatters the early morning tranquility!

Can tigers run that fast? Hobbes: Of course. Calvin: Really? Let&#39;s see you do it. Hobbes: Oh, I can&#39;t now. Calvin: Yeah? Why not? Hobbes: I&#39;m not wearing my drag chute.

Hobbes: Because we walked here. Calvin: No, no... I mean here on earth. Hobbes: Because Earth can support life. Calvin: No, I mean why are we anywhere? Why do we exist? Hobbes: Because we were born. Calvin: Forget it. Hobbes: I will, thank you.

No demands at all! Perfect freedon! The whole day stretches before us with unlimitied opportunity! And what better way to appreciate that opportunity than by squandering it watching cartoons all day!

Mom:  You just had one.  Calvin:  I want one to keep by the bed, so I can douse this guy if he starts snoring.  Mom:  Good night, Calvin.  Hobbes:  Hee hee hee hee  Calvin:  Oh great. He&#39;s dreaming again.  Where do you think you are, you imbecile?  Out in the jungle?  Hobbes:  ...mm..heh heh heh heh  Calvin:  If he starts &quot;running&quot; He&#39;s gonna get a pillow in the kisser.  Hobbes:  Sniff sniff.  Calvin:  Hey! Where are you going?  Calvin:  Sonnambulists give me the creeps.  Why are we going to the kitchen.  Dad:  Calvin!  What are you doing?  Have you been sleepwalking??  Calvin: I was completely awake!  It&#39;s this dope who&#39;s sleepwalking!  I just followed him.  Dad:  I put him back to bed.  He couldn&#39;t give any reason for being up.  Mom:  Do you suppose it mean&#39;s anything?  Look, he got out all the tuna!

Lunch, my favorite meal! And today&#39;s lunch is extra special! Ever since the weather got warm I&#39;ve been swatting flies and saving them in a jar. Finally I got enough bugs to mash them into a gooey paste with a spoon. I call it &quot;but butter.&quot; Care for a taste? Susie: Tell me, Calvin. Do you hae ny friends at all?

Anyone? Calvin, how about you? Calvin: Hard to say, ma&#39;am. I think my cerebellum just fused.

Dad: It&#39;s because hot air rises. The sun&#39;s hot in the middle of the day, so it rises high in the sky. In the evening then, it cools down and sets. Calvin: Why does it go from east to west? Dad: Solar wind. Mom: Dear!

Try to guess it. Hobbes: Eleven? Calvin: Nope. Guess again. Hobbes: Six million and four. Calvin: Nope. Guess again. What&#39;s the matter. Don&#39;t you like games??

Hobbes: Nah. Calvin: Oh, I do. Hobbes: Really? How come? Calvin: Life&#39;s a lot more fun when you&#39;re not responsible for your actions.

Hobbes:  Could you stop the room, please&gt;  I&#39;d like to get off.

You dropped another five points. It seems that although your recognition factor is high, your scandals of your administration continue to haunt you. Dad: Scandals? What scandals?! Calvin: Bedtimefate and homeworkgate come readily to mind Dad: Instances of true leadership. History will vindicate me. Calvin: I woner what my new dad will look like?
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|4|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/04/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/11fc9e00dec20131719a005056a9545d|305|900|Calvin: You&#39;ll be glad to know I&#39;ve analyzed you poor showing in the polls. Dad: I&#39;ll bet. Calvin: See, your record in office is miseravle and the character issue is killing you. Your basic approval rating among six-year-olds hardly registers. If anyone ever needed a slick campaign, it&#39;s you. Dad: Let me guess what you have in mind. Calvin: &quot;The new dad&quot; I call it.

Dad: Difficult doesn&#39;t begin to describe it. Calvin: I worked up some slogans. See what you think. Calvin: &quot;Dad-gradually he catches on.&quot; &quot;Vote Dad! This time, he&#39;ll do better.&quot; &quot;To forgive is devine-vote dad in &#39;88.&quot; Da: I get the idea, Calvin.

Dad: My image. Calvin: Right. See, now everyone thinks you&#39;re insensitive to the legitimate needs of minors. A few magnanimous gestures while in office now might be in order. If your mind&#39;s gone blank, I have some suggestions. Dad: Oh, the suspense. Calvin: For example, you might repeal makdatory school attendance. That alone could rocket you to victory.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|4|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/04/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/16015730dec20131719a005056a9545d|294|900|Dad: Much as I appreciate your offer, I don&#39;t think I need an image consultant. I prefer to let the wisdom of my words and deeds speak for themselves. Calvin IN that case, you&#39;ll have a lot of time to write your memoirs. Dad: We&#39;ll see. Now it&#39;s past your bedtime. Calvin: &quot;Dad buried in landslide! Jubilant throngs fill streets! Stunned father inconsolable demands recount!&quot; Dad: Good night.

Hobbes:  Yes, you can certainly see far from up here.  Calvin:  I call it &quot;lookout&quot; hill because that&#39;s what you yell whenever we go down it.  You know, sometimes it seems things go by too quickly.  We&#39;re so busy watching out for what&#39;s just ahead of us that we don&#39;t take the time to enjoy where we are.  Days go by and we hardly notice them.  Life becomes a blur. Often it takes some calamity to make us live in the present.  Then suddenly we wake up and see all the mistakes we&#39;ve made.  But it&#39;t too late to change anything.  It&#39;s like...it&#39;s like...  Hobbes:  It&#39;s like what?  Calvin:  It&#39;s like something I just can&#39;t think of it.

Eleven more year of school to go. Then college, then maybe graduate school, and then I work until I die. What kind of world is this?! You only get five years to be a kid?? What about exploring and discovering and playing? Those things are important, too! Hobbes: Well, you still have afternoons and weekends. Calvin: That&#39;s when I watch TV.

Want to help me build it? Hobbes: Sure. Calvin: Wow, a phantom jet! I can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s done! Hobbes: Look at all the little pieces. Calvin: Here, you put those pieces together, and I&#39;ll do these. Then we&#39;ll stick yours on mine, Ok? Hobbes: Shouldn&#39;t we read the instructions? Calvin: Do I look like a sissy?

Calvin: Uh oh, I got glue on my hands. Hobbes: It starts in english, but then it goes into french and spanish. Calvin: This stuff is worse than mozzarella cheese. Hobbes: It&#39;s hard to believe this model is for ages six and up. Calvin: Yecchh. What a mess. Hobbes: You have to be tri-lingual just to read the directions. Calvin: I hope mom likes this newspaper on the floor, because it&#39;s sure not going anywhere.

This wheel strut snapped. Why do they make &#39;em so darn small? I guess that was an optional piece. Hobbes: My wheel won&#39;t fit in the wheel well. Calvin: Here, let me try. Sometimes you just have to...Darn it! Hobbes: This plane is in for some rough landings.

It looks awful! Our plane doesn&#39;t look anything like the picture on the box. Hobbes: Maybe we can fix it when we paint it. Calvin: I can&#39;t paint it like this. Look how good they did this! How&#39;d they paint eyebrows on a pilot that&#39;s less than an inch tall? Hobbes: I think that&#39;s a real jet superimposed on a plastic stand.

Nothing fit right, the instructions were incomprehensible, the decals ripped, the paint slopped, and the glue got everywhere. What a disaster. Six bucks completely down the drain. I can&#39;t think of an afternoon I&#39;ve enjoyed less. What a waste. What a dumb hobby. ...Of course with this for practice. I&#39;ll bet we could do great on another model! Hobbes: Let&#39;s get one of those clipper ships with all the riggings.

Calvin&#39;s F-4 Phanton screams across the sky!  But what&#39;s this?  The canopy glass is all smeared!  He can hardly see through it!  Oh, no!  The throttle shaps off in his hand!  Calvin&#39;s only hope is to land, but the wheels refuse to open!  They&#39;re stuck!  Frantically Calvin trieds to eject, but the cockpit is fused together!  His jet is a hopeless mess!  Everything is going wrong!  Stupid model.

If that was true, you&#39;d disappear as soon as the person in the puddle moved away from the puddle, right? Calvin: Gee, I guess so. I hadn&#39;t thought of that.

Susie: Is it disgusting? Calvin: Um...well... Susie: Is it some creepy, gooey thing that no one in his right mind would ever, ever want to look at? Calvin: Uh...I suppose that depends on your point of view.... Susie: Forget it. I&#39;m not guessing. Calvin: You might as well. You&#39;re nine-tenths there.

Mom: A what? Calvin: You know, a larve. Did I really pupate at age two? Mom: Don&#39;t be disgusting! Of course not! Where did you ever get that awful idea?! Calvin: You should get your stories straight with mom, Mr. Britannica!

They&#39;re just half-hour commercials for toys. And where they&#39;re not boring, they&#39;re preachy. And these characters don&#39;t even move. They just stand around blinking! What kind of cartoon is that? Calvin: Meet my dad, the Gene Siskel of Saturday morning TV.

Well, you can just stay down there forever Mr. Stinker. Calvin: Oh, no! Here comes Susie! Let me up quick, so we can throw things at her! Hurry! Let down the rope! Hobbes: La de da dum doo. Calvin: She&#39;s coming! Quick! Let down the rope! I&#39;m sorry I insulted you! Ok! See, I said I was sorry! Can&#39;t you let down the rope?! Hobbes: You have to say the password.

Mom: What do you want it for. Calvin: Hobbes and I are going on an archaeological expidition. Mom: If you&#39;re looking for fossilized remains, you should dig through your room. Calvin: Ha ha. Someday I&#39;ll make and australopithecus woman after you.

It&#39;s amazing stuff. Scientists can tell hos old something is just by analyzing the layers of dirt it&#39;s in. Hey! Hobbes: Why, you must be six years old. Calvin: Oh, you&#39;re a scream.

Each rock has to be painstakingly brushed and scraped so nothing is broken or missed. Arghaelolgists have the most mind-numbing job on the planet. Hobbes: I don&#39;t think your dad will want to shave with this tomorrow.

I hit something! Hobbes: Don&#39;t breal it! Dig carefully! Calvin: Gosh, what do you suppose it is? Hobbes: Dust it off so we can see. Calvin: It&#39;s some bizarre skull! Hobbes: Look at it&#39;s mouth. Maybe it&#39;s a prehistoric anteater.

I can&#39;t believe we found a dinosaur skull on our very first archaeological dig! It&#39;s completely intact, too! What a discovery! Hobbes: Maybe the rest of the skeleton is nearby! Calvin: Yeah! If we can find the whole thing, we&#39;ll be world famous! With the grant money we&#39;ll get we can buy a porche! Hobbes: How will this look on the cover ot national geographic?

I found another bone! Boy, this is a weird one. What is it? Hobbes: It could be a forearm and fingers. Calvin: I can&#39;t wait to see what the complete calvinosaur looks like. Hobbes: I didn&#39;t know bones came in decorator colors, did you?

We&#39;re on the move!  Up through the winding maze!  Faster!  Faster!  Calvin scrambles up the grainy tunnel!  Out he pops into the blinding sun!  Calvin the ant rushes down the hill to the brick walk!  Other ants rush around him in their mad hurry!  Calvin tries to keep up! At last he reaches the monstrous dead caterpillar!  Without pausing, he hoists it up!  The queen demands his tireless toil!  Calvin is back off to the ant hill as fast as he can go!  Calvin:  Work, work, work!  That&#39;s all I&#39;m good for around here!  Mom:  I hardly think picking up your room once in a while qualtifies you as a slave.

Let&#39;s glue them together so we can see how they fit. Then you can draw a reconstruction of the actual dinosaur. After that, we&#39;ll write up our findings, and get them published in a scientific journal. Then we&#39;ll win the nobel prize, get rich, and go on talk shows. Hobbes: What about babes? When do we get those?

Try to draw the dinosaur as it really looked with muscles and skin. Hobbes: Right. Calvin: What&#39;s it doing? Whistling? Hobbes: You tell me. Maybe it&#39;s puckering up.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|5|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/05/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/33979050dec20131719a005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin: See the dinosaur we discovered and assembled? I&#39;m going to call the natural history museum and tell them they can have it for tem billion dollars. Mom: Those are ...um... peculiar bones. Calvin: Do you think I should ask for more money? Mom: That&#39;s not quite what I meant.

She says we just dug up some trash somebody littered. Our dinosaur is a fraud. Hobbes: I guess it wouldn&#39;t be right to sell it to a museum then. Calvin: Not a full price, anyway.

Calvin pilots the jet airliner across the country at 35,000 feet. He is given clearance to land. But what&#39;s this? A plane from a rival airline is making for the same runway to shave precious minutes off its schedule! It&#39;s a 600-mph game of chicken!  Calvin pulls back on the throttle and lurches ahead! The other pilot tries to cut Calvin off with a sudden drop in altitude! Calvin switches on the &quot;fasten seat belt&quot; light in the cabin, and does a barrel roll! At 5Gs, Calvin hopes not to black out! As they close in on the runway, the other pilot has no choice but to pull up and circle around again! Calvin wins! Hey, Mom, is it true I could get a pilots license at age 14? Mom: No.

You&#39;ve got to help me! I&#39;m in big trouble! Hobbes: What&#39;s the matter? Calvin :You know how Dad said I could use his binoculars as long as I was extra careful with them? Well, I just broke them by accident! Now I need some advice. Should I run away, or commit hara-kiri? Hobbes: Over the binocualrs? Calvin: Yeah. Hobbes: Maybe both.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|5|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/05/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3a451af0dec20131719a005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin: Geez, I can&#39;t believe I broke Dad&#39;s binoculars! He&#39;ll blow every capillary in his body! Dad say I had to be very very careful with them, and what did I do? I go and break them, he&#39;ll flay me alive! Hobbes: How did you do it, anyway? Calvin: I just dropped them. Hobbes: And they broke? Calvin: Well, I was tossing them to myself at the time, as I ran down the sidewalk.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|5|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/05/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3b99f030dec20131719a005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin How much money do you have, Hobbes? Maybe we can buy Dad a new pair of binocualrs before he gets home. Hobbes: I&#39;be got thirty...no, thirty-five cents. Calvin: Great. I&#39;be got four dollars. Let&#39;s call the store. Hello? I&#39;d like to know how much a good pair of binocualrs costs. One to six hundred dollars?! Do you have any idea what my dad&#39;s going to do to me?!? Hobbes: He won&#39;t stop at killing you, that&#39;s for sure, uh uh.

We&#39;re doomed! We&#39;re doomed! Hobbes: &quot;We&quot;? Why in the world did Dad let me use anything so valuable?! He should&#39;ve known I&#39;d break them! He must&#39;ve been out of his mind! This is all his fault! What am I gonna do?! Hobbes: I suppose you could just tell him what happened... Calvin: ...And make my getaway when the coronary hits? Say, that&#39;s an idea!

You think? Hobbes: It depends. Was the casing just chipped a little, or did the lens itself get cracked? Calvin: Well, maybe you&#39;d better look at it. Calvin: Don&#39;t sneeze.

Calvin: Tell mom?!? Are you crazy? No way! Hobbes: Why not? You&#39;ve got to tell someone. Maybe she can think of something. Calvin: At times like these, all mom can think of is how long she was in labor with me.

I got a hit! Hobbes: Only because I let you! Adam: Ha ha! A home run! Hobbes: You didn&#39;t touch all the bases! Calvin: I did too. Hobbes: No, you didn&#39;t. You didn&#39;t touch seventh base. Calvin: Yes, I did! I touched the water barrel right after the front porch. Hobbes: That&#39;s not seventh base. That&#39;s twelfth base! Calvin: I thought the garage door was twelfth. Hobbes: The garage door is twenty-third base. You touched them all out of of order, and you still didn&#39;t touch the secret base. Calvin: The secret base?? What&#39;s the secret base?! Hobbes: I can&#39;t tell you. It&#39;s a secret. Calvin: I can&#39;t believe this moronic sport is our national pastime. Hobbes: You&#39;re out. Give me a dollar.

Calmly eating his dinner as if nothing was wrong. I know him. His &quot;Dad radar&quot; is beeping like crazy. He knows I broke something. He just doesn&#39;t know what. He can&#39;t nail me until he knows for sure. He&#39;ll just wait. I know him. He&#39;s going to just sit there eating and let me stew in my own guilt. He figures sooner or later I&#39;ll crack. Dad: Calvin? Calvin: Aaugh! I did it! I did it! I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to!! Dad: ...pass the uh...the uh...

Didn&#39;t I tell you to be extral, extra careful with them?? Isn&#39;t that exactly what I said?! Well?! Those binoculars were brand new! Have you no respect for other people&#39;s property?!? Calvin: I have an idea, Dad, let&#39;s pretend I already feel terrible about it, and that you don&#39;t need to rub it in anymore.
Sun Dec 31 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1988|5|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/05/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/43b9f180dec20131719a005056a9545d|300|900|Calvin: I didn&#39;t mean to break your binoculars, Dad. It was an accident. I&#39;m really sorry. I felt like I was going to barf all afternoon. Dad: Well, I&#39;m sorry I yelled at you like I did. I shouldn&#39;t have been so angry. Afterall, it was just a pair of binoculars. In the big scheme of things, that&#39;s really not so bad. Calvin: (sniff) really? Dad: Sure...In another ten years, you&#39;ll probably be wrecking my car.

Dad got me my own pair of little binoculars! Hobbes: Wow, these are yours? Calvin: Aren&#39;t they great? Hobbes: I&#39;ll say. Calvin: Dad said as long as I was going to break binoculars, I ought to break my own. Hobbes: Now we can go to the beach and look at babes! Calvin: Maybe I should break Dad&#39;s power tools and see if I could get some of those.

Look at all the stars. Millions of them! Yes, we&#39;re just tiny specks on a planet particle, hurling through the infinite blackness. Let&#39;s go in and turn on all the lights.

Contamination! Pestilence! Ha ha ha! Of all living creatures, few are more repulsive than Calvin the bug! He exists only to suck blood and transmit parasitic disease! Searching for someone to infect, Calvin flies low over the picnic table! His sensitive antennae pick up the scent of human flesh! Touching down, Calvin inserts his neddlelike proboscis into a vein!  Protozoans in his saliva quickly induce plague! Mom: Will you stop that awful slurping?! You&#39;re making me sick!

There&#39;s a bee on your back! Calvin: Thereis?! Shoo it away! Quick! Hobbes: And have it come after me? No, thanks. Calvin: Well, what am I supposed to do? Stand like this all day? Hobbes: I guess you don&#39;t have much choice. Do you? Calvin: Great. Just great. I could be here forever! Hobbes: Say, that gives me an idea. Calvin: Don&#39;t you go reading my comic books! Stay out of my room!

I can&#39;t move because I&#39;ve got a bee on my back, so he goes to read all my comic books! He always gets them out of order, and he folds the covers back! Ooh, if I could only move! What kind of friend would take advantage of a predicament like this? A lousy friend, that&#39;s what kind! What a stinker he is! Hobbes: Hey, did you see how the latest issue of Captain Napalm ended? Calvin: Don&#39;t tell me! Don&#39;t tell me!

By golly, you hairball, if I didn&#39;t have a bee on my back right now, I&#39;d... Hobbes: Maybe there&#39;s a bee and maybe there isn&#39;t. I&#39;ll never tell. Calvin: What?! Is the bee gone? Can I move! Is it still there?? Huh? Rrggh! Is it?!

You don&#39;t? How about plastic explosives? You&#39;re kidding. Well, what about land mines? Do you sell those? ...You don&#39;t? Look, I&#39;m trying to send a girl I know into deep space.

We need an attitude. Hobbes: An attitude? Calvin: Yeah, you can&#39;t be cool if you don&#39;t have an attitude. Hobbes: Really? Calvin: Sure. They&#39;re all the rage. Now what kind of attitude could we have. Hobbes: We could be courtously differential. Calvin: Oh, good. That&#39;s real cool.

Hobbes: Not the way they&#39;re going. Calvin: That&#39;s what I thought. I guess that means it&#39;s up to us then. Hobbes: Somehow, I&#39;m not reassured. Calvin: Ha! When I&#39;m president, I&#39;ll have things whipped into shape in no time.

Mom: Rain? What are you talking about? There isn&#39;t a cloud in the sky! Calvin: You don&#39;t think it looks like rain. Mom: No. Go away and stop being silly.

Hobbes: What do you mean? This isn&#39;t your hammock. Calvin: It&#39;s my turn. Hobbes: I was here first. It&#39;s your turn when I&#39;m done. Calvin: If you won&#39;t get out, then I&#39;m coming in with you. Hobbes: Like heck you are! Dad: This crummy hammock always sags.

Calvin: Nope. So far, our expedition is a failure. Hobbes: How&#39;s the water? Calvin: Absolutely frigid. My feet are completely numb. If I go in just a half-inch every ten minutes, I can stand it. Getting your swimsuit wet is the worst part, though. As soon as it touches the water, it soaks up and clings to you, and gets you wet before you&#39;re ready. Hobbes: Why don&#39;t you just jump in and get it over with? Calvin: Are you kidding? The shock would kill me! It&#39;s better to go in a wee bit at a time. Hobbes: No, it&#39;s better to do it all at once.  It&#39;s worse to drag it out. Calvin: You must&#39;ve been dropped when you were little. Hobbes: I&#39;ll show you! Look out! Calvin: No! No! No! Hobbes: Brr-r-r-r-! Maybe you were right. Calvin: We&#39;ll never know now, will we?!?

Mom and Dad are throwing duffel bags in the car. They&#39;re going on vacation! At last! Finally we get the house to ourselves! We can stay up late and watch TV! We can eat cookies for dinner! We... Dad: What are you doing up here still? C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go. Calvin: Me? Go? Go where? Dad: On vacation! What have we been planning all month? Calvin: With you and Mom?? What kind of vacation is that?!

I sure hope we&#39;re not camping again this year? Dad: Well, we are. Calvin: Oh, no! Why do we have to go camping?! I hate camping! Calvin: Swatting mosquitos while lying frozen and cramped on bumpy rocks, with no TV and only canned food to eat, is not my idea of a good time! Dad: that&#39;s why we brought bug spray. Calvin: Look, just let me out here, ok? I&#39;ll hitch home and see you when you get back, all  right?

It poured so hard we couldn&#39;t even make a fire. Without question, that was one of the worst experieces of my life. Dad: Yes, but it built character. Calvin: Oh, sure. Why can&#39;t I ever build character at a Miame condo or a casino somewhere?

Home away from home! Ok, Calvin, you get out with your mom, and I&#39;ll hand our gear to you. Now don&#39;t drop this, it&#39;s very...Calvin: Oops. Don&#39;t worry, Dad. It&#39;s only about ten feet deep. I can see the camera and everythin. Dad: I am going to feed you to the sea gulls, kid. Mom: Dear, you came here to relax.

Here, that&#39;s all that I could find down there. Go get me a towel, Calvin. It never fails. The one bag the kid dumps in the drink has all the fragile and perishable items in it. Mom: Well, the week can only improve from here. Dad: One would like to think so. Calvin: Hey, Dad, did you mean to stack the tackle box and all this on your glasses?

What a grouch! I don&#39;t see why he can&#39;t be civil just because I accidntally dropped a duffel bag overboard and he broke his glasses. Hobbes Are you going to tell him he left the car lights on back where we got the canoe? Calvin I think you should tell him.

Hobbes: ten billion to one, my favor. Calvin: It is not! Hobbes: Then keep track yourself. Calvin: Ha! it went straight up! Easy out! Easy out! You&#39;re not even going to run, eh? I don&#39;t blame you. You&#39;re as good as out. You can&#39;t do that! Hobbes: That&#39;s two hits on one pitch! this run counts double!

Don&#39;t you want to come along? Mom: Uggh, no. The last thing I want to see at this ungodly hour is a bunch of fish gasping and flopping in the slop at the bottom of a boat. All I&#39;d like to see is a decent newspaper, a fresh muffin and a pot of real coffee. Calvin: Why&#39;d we ever come here then? Dad: Go ask Conan the Barbariam. Dad: C&#39;mon, Calvin. I&#39;ll teach you to put a worm on a hook.

Up at dawn! Fresh air! Tranquility! No demands, no phones, no pressure! The whole day is one&#39;s own! Isn&#39;t this great? Isn&#39;t this the life? Calvin: Spaceman Spiff, a prisoner on the zog slave gallery, plans his daring overboard escape! Dad: Ahh, what a day!

Painting a picture? Dad: Yep. Calvin: What&#39;s that thing? A brontosaurus with rabies? Dad: It&#39;s that island over there. Calvin: Oh. How far can you see without your glasses? Can you see me? Dad: When I look up, I&#39;d better not be able to.

I mean, it&#39;s not as if I runied his lousy picture, right? Why should... Mom: Calvin, can&#39;t you see I&#39;m trying to read? Calvin: Ever notice how tense grown-ups get when they&#39;re recreating?

You&#39;re &quot;it&quot;! Hobbes: That&#39;s not fair! Calvin: Tag! I gotcha! Hobbes: Ok. Now I&#39;m &quot;it&quot; and I have to catch you. Calvin: But what about a penalty? Don&#39;t you go to &quot;jail&quot; and do pushups first? Hobbes: No, I&#39;m just &quot;it&quot;. There aren&#39;t any penalties. Calvin: None?? Don&#39;t I even get free hits? Hobbes: Free hits?! No, you don&#39;t get free hits! Calvin: Just, like, on the arm? I think you shoud have to get hit on the arm. Hobbes: I don&#39;t have to get hit at all! Calvin: Well, what about an Indian burn then? or noogies? Can I give you noogies? Hobbes: No! I&#39;m just &quot;it&quot;! That&#39;s all that happens! Calvin: Ok, ok! That&#39;s all that happens! Sheesh. If you ask me, though, any game without push-ups, hits burns or noogies is a sissy game. Hobbes; Well, you can get hit if you want.

Hobbes: That&#39;s sort of the point, don&#39;t you think? It&#39;s good to stop running around. Sometimes one should just look at things and think about things, without doing things. Calvin: You&#39;re certainly the expert on that. Hobbes: What I loke is when you&#39;re looking and thinking and looking and thinking... and suddenly you wake up.

Hobbes: Frankly, I&#39;m not sure your mom know so much about tigers. Calvin: Look, we just want to avoid an argument, right?

Start packing up. We&#39;re going home. Calvin: Finally! Dad: Now, now. These little outings are valuable experiences. Calvin: Yeah? How? Dad: They give us a chance to be together as a family and learn about ourselves. Calvin: Like how we can&#39;t stand baing in such close proximity with one another this long? Dad: Exactly.

Of course my grip could weaken, or I could get sucked into a jet intake. That&#39;s one of the remarkable things about like. It&#39;s never so bad that it can&#39;t get worse.

I&#39;ve been calling and calling. Your dinner&#39;s cold, I&#39;m sure. I drifted away on my balloon and it popped, but fortunately I had my transmogrifier, so after I mistakenly turned myself into a safe, I transmogrified into a light particle and zipped back home instantaneously! ...Of course, if I&#39;d known we were having this, I wouldn&#39;t have hurried. Mom: Sometime you should try transmogrifying yourself into someone who occasionally makes an ounce of sense.

Calvin: Will you pay me? Dad: Well...Ok, I&#39;ll pay you a dollar. Calvin: A dollar? I won&#39;t do it for less than twenty-five!! Dad: In a minute you&#39;ll do it for nothing just because I told you to. Calvin: ...I&#39;ll take the dollar. Dad: Smart kid.

Safe!  Ok, that was a single.  I have a ghost runner here now, so I can bat again.  And my ghost runners who were on first and second base are now on second and third, right?  Hobbes:  Nope.  They&#39;re both out.  Calvin: Out?!  Hobbes:  My ghost outfielder tagged your ghost going to third, and threw to my ghost second baseman.  It was a brilliant double play.  Calvin: That never happened!  Hobbes:  You&#39;ve got two outs. Calvin:  Well, my ghost on first just stole home, so I&#39;ve got another run! Ha ha, Smarty!  Hobbes:  Yeah, Well, all my outfield ghosts just ran in and beat the tobacco juice out of him.  Calvin:  Ha!  The ghost umpire just suspended all your ghosts for eternity.  They&#39;re out of the game.  Hobbes:  Hmph!  If my ghosts don&#39;t play, I don&#39;t play.  Calvin:  You forfeit the game then!  You lost automatically if you quit!  Hobbes:  the ghost growd supports me. They&#39;re &quot;Boo-ing&quot; you!  Calvin:  Sometimes I wish I lived in a neighborhood with more kids.

We&#39;re already! Dad: Boy, I haven&#39;t been to the zoo in ages. Mom: And Calvin&#39;s never been. This will be fun. I&#39;ve been telling him about it all week. He&#39;s so excited. Dad: C&#39;mon, Calvin! Hobbes: So where do we have to go now? Calvin: Beats me, Mom and Dad are always dragging us some dumb place.

Dad: So they don&#39;t get out and eat people. Calvin: Does the zoo ever throw anyone in? Dad: Don&#39;t be silly. Of course not. Calvin: How soon until we go home?

Monkeys! Mom: See how they use their tails and feet to climb? Zoos let people see how wild animals really behave. Calvin: Hey, ook what that monkey&#39;s doing! Right in public too! Ha ha! That&#39;s gross! How come I&#39;m not allowed to do that?! Parent: Come look at the birds over here, Calvin.

Hobbes: I think it&#39;s kind of depressing. I always feel sorry for the animals. They don&#39;t have much room to move, or anything to do. They just sleep until they&#39;re fed. Calvin: That&#39;s pretty much all you do. Hobbes: You know what I mean.

Mom, can I get some peanuts to fee the animals? Woman: I&#39;m not your mom. Calvin: Whoop! Woman: Are you lost? What does your mom look like? Calvin: From the knees down she looks just like you.

Why don&#39;t mom&#39;s write their names on their calves so this kind of think wouldn&#39;t happen? I wonder where I am. And were&#39;s Hobbes? I thought he was right with me. Mom: Uh oh. Where&#39;s Calvin? Dad: Why do these little family trips always turn out this way? I&#39;m going to spend more Saturdays at the office.

Dad: I don&#39;t see him. Mom: Where could he have gone? We just turned our backs for a minute. Dad: And why didn&#39;t he take Hobbes? Dad: You stay here in case he comes back, and I&#39;ll go look for him. Mom: Ok. (sigh) Dad: Being a parent is wanting to hug and strangle your kid at the same time.

Calvin could be anywhere in this zoo. I hope he at least has the sense to stay put, wherever he is. Where would the little rotter go if he was lost and separated from his stuffed toy? Calvin: His name is Hobbes, and he&#39;s...Hey! I&#39;m talking to you!!

Thank goodness! Where was he? Dad: Looking at the tigers. Calvin: I followed another lady, thinking it was Mom, and then when I realized I was lost, I went to ask the tigers if they&#39;d seen Hobbes. Mom: Next time you should ask a person for help. Calvin: ...Oh... That never occurred to me. Dad: Only next time, there won&#39;t be a next time, because we&#39;re just going to tie you to a stake in the yard every weekend. Mom: Dear! Calvin: A fat lot of hely your compatriots were, I might add.

Well, I&#39;ve got a big can of it here. It&#39;s up to me to decide if you get water or not! I control your fate! Your very lives are in my hands! Without me you&#39;re as good as dead! Without me, you don&#39;t...

How did you ever get so muddy?  Well, I was just standing there, minding my own business, when all of a  sudden, a horde of dirty cannibals comes...Dad:  Forget it.  Boy, what a delightful afternoon.  Sometimes, I feel like I work all the time to afford this place, and I never get to sit back with a good book and enjoy it.  Well, at least I have the weekends to..... Mom:  Calvin!  You got mud all over the house!  Look at you!  Aiee - the couch!  What&#39; you do?!  Did you walk across the couch?!  Calvin:  I didn&#39;t do it!  Someone else must have!  I just saw a muddy guy go running from...Mom:  Out!  Out of the house now!  Calvin:  Ok, ok!  I&#39;m going!  You don&#39;t need to push!  I can tell when I&#39;m not wanted!  Hey!  Leggo!  Ow!  All right, good bye!  Hey, Dad, catch the water balloon!  Great reflexes, Dad, by the way, don&#39;t go in the house like that, Mom&#39;s in one of her moods again.  Dad:  I&#39;ll bet I could get a lot of work done at the office on weekends.

Where is he?? Oh, there&#39;s Hobbes. Thank goodness. Mom: You haven&#39;t been looking well, Calvin. Maybe you should go to bed earlier.

Too bad you can&#39;t stay home to enjoy it. When you&#39;re old you&#39;ll be sorry you never took advantage of days like these, but of course, that&#39;s far off, and in the meantime, there&#39;s lots of work to be done. Yep, you&#39;d better go to work. Have a good long drive in traffic. Maybe you&#39;ll get home in time to watch the sun set...if you can stay awake. So long! Golly, I&#39;d hate to have a kid like me.

Hobbes: Take the worst thing you can imagine, and imagine something a hundred times worse than that. Calvin: You&#39;d do that? Hobbes: No, I&#39;d do something even worse. Calvin: He piqued my curiosity.

All you do is take it apart, see what&#39;s leaking, plug it up, and put it back together. Hobbes: Does your mom know you&#39;re doing this. Calvin: Nope. It&#39;s going to be a surprise. Hobbes: And we all know how she loves surprises. Calvin: I can&#39;t get this handle off. Pass me the hack saw, wil you?

Calvin: That&#39;s the problem I&#39;m trying to fix, you moron! I can&#39;t turn the water off because the faucet leaks! Sheesh, where we you when they were passing out brains. Oh no! Auchh! Ackk!

How do you turn off the water?!? Hobbes: How should I know?? Calvin: I can&#39;t put this piece back in with all this water coming out! Hobbes: I&#39;ll get your mom! Calvin: My mom? Have you lost your mind?? She can&#39;t find out about this! Hobbes: I&#39;ll bet she notices when the kitchen ceiling starts to drip. Calvin: Open the medicine cabinet! Find some cyanide!

What a sorehead! Listening to him, you&#39;d think nobody in the world had ever needed to call a plumber before. Dad&#39;s got a job. He can afford it. Dad makes such a big deal out of everything.

Hobbes:  What&#39;s it called?  Calvin:  &quot;The Hydeous Monster Who Waits in Your Back Yard To Dismember You.&quot;  Gosh, this the the creepiest story I&#39;ve every heard!  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t stop.  Keep reading.  Calvin: &quot;Slowly the bog monster approached the innocent campers..Fangs glistening in the moonlight, it...Hobbes:  What was that noise?  Calvin:  Oh, stop it.  This is scary enough.  Hobbes:  No, really, I heard something!  Listen!  Calvin:  Snap!  It&#39;s the bog monster!  Hobbes:  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  quick!  Turn out the flashlight!  Lie still!  Calvin:  It&#39;s coming this way!  We&#39;re doomed!  Hobbes:  It&#39;s getting closer and closer!  Calvin:  Oh, my gosh.  It&#39;s..it&#39;s opening the tent flap!  It&#39;s coming in!  Aiee!  There it is!  Blind it with the flashlight!  Pull down the tent poles!  Run, Hobbes, run!  Mom:  What are you doing in here!!  Where&#39;s your Dad?  He just went out to check on you.

There&#39;s no gravity! Calvin pushes off the ceiling at a sharp andle, aiming for the hallway! He glides with unchecked momentum, turning himself to be able to push off the next stationary surface. Mom: C&#39;mon you! Outside! You&#39;re really bouncing off the walls today. Calvin: Aw, Mom.

It&#39;s a gigantic ant! With one footstep, ti pulverizes the entire downtown! Millions die instantly! The ant brushes the city off the map! People flood the streets in panic, only to be smashed in the horrible wreckage! Well...maybe I won&#39;t...

Nobody notices until his orbit takes him directly between the sun and earth. Calvin causes a total solar eclipse! Earth is shrouded in darkness. How long will Calvin stay there?! Mom: Could you move, please? You&#39;re in my light. calvin: Ha ha haaa!

Dad: A running mate? Calvin: Sure. You can&#39;t be elected Dad without a Mom, right? Are you going to kee the mom I&#39;ve had, or get a new running mate? Dad: Gee.. Mom: Bedtime, Calvin.

My favorite ritual is eating three bowls of &quot;chocolate frosted sugar bombs&quot; and watching TV cartoons all Saturday morning. After a few hours, I&#39;m so overstimulated I can&#39;t sit till or even think straight. Hobbes: Sort of a transcendental experience, huh? Calvin: Yeah, I acheive a lower consciousness.

Mom:  Why?  Calvin:  Somebody puked on mine.  Mom:  Just eat your dinner and keep quiet, ok, Calvin?  Calvin:  Ewwww  MMF!  Hoopa  Argh!  Flip, flop. Blahhhhhhh  Mom:  Oh, knock it off, Calvin.  It&#39;s hamburger casserole. There&#39;s not a thing in there you don&#39;t like.  Calvin:  This hamburger?  Chew Chew.  Hmm. This bite wasn&#39;t so bad, for some reason, I was able to choke it down, anyway.  My stomach is still cramping up, but the pains aren&#39;t as sharp any more.  The secret is to suppress the gag reflex.  After I swallow it, I can stand it.  Mom:  Good.  I&#39;m glad this is such a hit.

What happened to summer. Susie: Gosh, I couldn&#39;t wait for today! Soon we&#39;ll be making new friends, learning all sorts of important things, and... calvin: What the matter with you?? Calvin: Your bangs do a good job of covering up the lobotomy stitches.

It&#39;s going to be a long year.

Get lost. Calvin: I&#39;m not scared of you Moe. Moe: Oh, no? Calvin: Nope. You&#39;re so dumb you probably never thought about how a sparrow&#39;s smaller size and greater maneuverability is an advantage in fighting off big crows. Moe: Yeah? Calvin: Those TV nature programs will be the death of me yet.

Free at last! Calvin: And just six precious hours before bed to forget everything I learned today. Calvin: I hate coming home from school. I never know if Hobbes is waiting to pounce on me. Calvin: Maybe I can stand off to the side here, and push the door open with a stick. Calvin: I&#39;m home! Calvin: What do you do, wait until you see the whites of my eyes?!? Hobbes: Boy, you should&#39;ve seen them! They were as big as dinner plates! Hoo hoo hoo!

Grown-ups really have the world fouled up. Acid rain, toxic wastes, holes in the ozone, sewage in the oceans, and on and on! The only bright side to all this is that eventually there may not be a piece of the planet worth fighting over.

Calvin: Yep. Get your toothbrush, Hobbes. We&#39;re outta here. It&#39;s an outrage how grown-ups have polluted the earth. I refuse to ingerit a spoiled planet! I&#39;m leaving! Hobbes: Really? Where to?? Calvin: You know, sometimes you&#39;re a real load to have around. Hobbes: I was just asking!

We could go there to avoid Earth&#39;s pollution. Calvin: Yeah! If we go now, we can claim it and keep everyone else off it. Hobbes: Ok, it&#39;s settled. Mars it is. Calvin: You finish packing. I&#39;ll go get the wagon. Hobbes: We&#39;re going in the wagon? Calvin: Of course! What did you want to do? Flap your arms? Hobbes: I guess I hadn&#39;t thought about that part. Calvin: Obviously.

Hobbes and I are going to Mars to live. Earth is too polluted. Mom: Have a good time. Calvin: Say goodbye to Dad for us. If I can find an interplanetary post office, I&#39;ll write you once in a while and... Mom: Calvin, don&#39;t stand there with the door open. You&#39;re letting in bugs. Either stay in or go outside. Hobbes: She didn&#39;t seem too choked up about us going did she? Calvin: We should&#39;ve left a long time ago.

Hobbes: Do you really think we&#39;ll get enough lift to break earth&#39;s gravity? Calvin: Of course! You think I didn&#39;t plan this out?! I thought of everything. Hobbes: Did you think of what you&#39;ll eat on our trip? Calvin: Packing was your job! Didn&#39;t you pack us any food?? Hobbes: I packed food for me...

When you see earth as a tiny blue speck in the infinite reaches of space, you have to wonder about the mysteries of creation. Surely we&#39;re all part of some gread design, no more or less important than anything else in the universe. Surely everything fits together and has a purpose, a reason for being. Doesn&#39;t it make you wonder? Hobbes: I wonder what happens if you throw up in zero gravity. Calvin: Maybe you should wonder what it&#39;s like to walk home.

We&#39;re coming in through Mars&#39; atmosphere. We&#39;ve landed! We&#39;re the first ones to ever set foot on another planet! What a historic moment! Calvin: I still can&#39;t believer you forgot the camera. I remembered it. You just didn&#39;t want to turn around.

Hobbes: Not yet... Calvin: Hey, look! It&#39;s the old &quot;Viking&quot; spacecraft that landed here in the &#39;70s! Calvin and Hobbes: Blahhh hoop hoop boola ackackack boola...

I guess we should unpack and set up camp. Comic books...comic books...tuna...some candy bars...more tuna...toothbrushes...a can opener...looks like we&#39;re all set. What&#39;s this? Hobbes: A night light. I thought it might be scary sleeping on a new planet. Calvin: Boy you thought of everything. Hobbes: Now we have to find an outlet.

We&#39;ve got a whole planet to outselves. Brand new and unspoiled. No people, no pollution. Nothing but rugged, natural beauty as far as the eye can see. Hobbes: That&#39;s not your candy bar wrapper over there, is it? Calvin: It was just there a minute! I wasn&#39;t going to leave it.

Hobbes: I do too. It&#39;s very peaceful. Calvin: Not only that, but we don&#39;t have Mom here to boss us around! No early bedtime, no baths, no disgusting dinners, no... Hobbes: Did that rock just move?? Calvin and Hobbes: Mommmmm!!

Dad: No, what?  Calvin: You should take out the stairs and put in an elevator.  Dad: Good. I&#39;ll file that with your idea for the moving sidewalk.  Calvin: Oh no! Whoaa oww ...wwch! Whoahh oww ...wwch  Whoa Oww ...wwch! Mom: Did you fall down the stairs again?  Calvin: That&#39;s me (oof), the human slinky.

There&#39;s something under it! Calvin; it must be a martian! Oh no! Oh no! It&#39;s probably some creepy, tentacled, bug-eyed monster! Hobbes: You&#39;re right! There&#39;s a tentacle now! Calvin: It&#39;s coming out! What will we do?! Calvin, Hobbes and martian: Aaughhhh...

Hobbes: I&#39;ll take a peek. I don&#39;t see him. He must have hidden. Calvin: Hidden?? Do you think he&#39;s scared of us? Hobbes: Why not? We&#39;re scared of him. Calvin: Yeah, but we&#39;re just ordinary earthlings, not weirdos from another planet, like he is.

Hobbes: Maybe martians don&#39;t like earthlings. Calvin: Don&#39;t like us?! What&#39;s there not to like?? There&#39;s nothing wrong with humans! Hey, you martian! Come on out! We&#39;re not bad! We just came here because people polluted our own planet so much that...uh...what I mean, is...um... So what are you saying? That our reputation preceded us? Hobbes: Would you welcome in a dog that wasn&#39;t house trained?

Calvin: Yeah, we may not be welcome here. We ought to fix up our own planet before we go messing around with other people&#39;s planets. Afterall, there&#39;s only one earth, and it&#39;s got to last us a while. Hobbes: We also should go home because we&#39;re out of tuna. Calvin: I hope Mom and Dad didn&#39;t rent out my room.

We&#39;re almost home! Look, you can see the continents. Hmm...If I remember my atlas, we live in a big purple country. Hobbes: And our house is by the giant letter &quot;E&quot; in the word &quot;states.&quot;

Guess what Hobbes and I did! We went to Mars! Dad: Well, well. Calvin: Yep. We were going to live there because Earth is so polluted, but we discovered that Mars is inhabited, so we came back home. Dad: You don&#39;t like the martians? Calvin: No, they didn&#39;t like us. I think they were afraid we&#39;d junk up Mars the way we&#39;ve junked up Earth. Dad: What&#39;s my good briefcase doing out and why does it smell like tuna fish?! Calvin: And can you believe it, Dad? We go clear to Mars, and dumb ol&#39; Hobbes forgets the camera!

Something is very wrong here.  Calvin has mysteriously shrunk to a quarter of an inch tall!  How can he make his plight known to his parents when he&#39;s smaller than a penny?  Calvin gets an idea! He grabs the leg of a passing housefly and flied to his dad&#39;s camera!  Once there, he climbs up and sets the self-timer.  Jumping on the shutter, Calvin has fifteen short seconds to get in front of the lens!  With luck, Calvin&#39;s dad will have the film developed soon, and discover what has happened?  Dad: What happened?!  Look at all these terrible pictures! I don&#39;t remember taking these.  Who&#39;s that little speck in the distance all the time?  You haven&#39;t been fooling with my camera, have you?  Calvin: Me? Heck, no.  Maybe you should get the camera fixed.

Yes, for the last two days I&#39;ve been kiiping it in this special zarnium-coated bag, and feeding it pure amonia! And now, the moment you&#39;ve all been waiting for! Aargh! Hobbes: How&#39;d it work? Calvin: My teacher says Mom and Dad both have to sign my report cards this year.

Mom: Mm-hmm. Calvin: My sensort indicate trace amounts of chocolate in the pantry. Please load some in my scoop for analysis. Mom: No, you&#39;ll spoil your appetite. Calvin: My mission must not fail. Prepare for annihlation, pitiful earth female. Mom: Go back to Jupiter, X-3 whatever.

A lot of kids don&#39;t have as good or a home life as we do. We really can&#39;t complain. ...Which isn&#39;t to say we should go home yet. Hobbes: When do you think they&#39;ll see the can windshield?

Guess what I brought for lunch. Susie: No! Go sit by someone else, Ok? You always say your lunch is something revoting, and I don&#39;t want to hear it! Calvin: Gee whiz, what&#39;s wrong with you? My lunch is peanut butter. What&#39;s so disgusting about that?! Susie: Hmph. I&#39;m glad that one day out of the year you can be civil. Calvin: It&#39;s my dessert that&#39;s gross! Look, a thermos full of phlegm!

People want to know where you stand on the issues. Dad: Such as? Calvin: Later bedtimes, expanded TV privileges, shorter school weeks, and less dicipline. Dad: I&#39;m against them all. Calvin: I see. How&#39;s your IRA? Pretty well funded? Dad: Go to bed.

Just my luck they&#39;d get married and have me.  I hate everybody.  I don&#39;t see how anyone could ever fall in love. People are jerks.  Hobbes: Sometimes they are, but look at all the colors on the trees today.  Calvin: Yeah? So what?  Hobbes: I think it&#39;s more fun to see something like this with someone than just by yourself.  Calvin: I guessss so...  but I&#39;d still rather see this with a tiger than a person.  Hobbes: Well, that goes without saying.

Why do kids always feel sick at two in the morning? Calvin probably just ate too much dessert. Ir he&#39;s going to get me up at this hour, he&#39;d better really be sick. Calvin: Barrrff Mom: I didn&#39;t mean it! Dad: Honey, pipe down. I&#39;m trying to sleep.

What if something is really wrong with me, and I have to go to the hospital?? What if they stick me full of tubes and hoses? What if they have to operate? What if the operation fails? What if this is my...my...last night...alive?? Hobbes: Then I can look forward to having the bed to myself tomorrow. Calvin: Few things are less comforting than a tiger who&#39;s up too late.

All they do is make themselves unhappy that way. Why get an ulcer over things that don&#39;t really matter?

I go to school, but never learn what I want to know.

I always have to postpone what I want to do for what I have to do! Dad: Welcome to the world. Calvin: Would you sign this parental excuse to get me out of the next 11 1/2 year of school.

Look at this one. He&#39;s carring a crumb that&#39;s bigger than he is, and he&#39;s running. And if you put an obstacle in front of him, he&#39;ll scramble like crazy until he gets across it. He doesn&#39;t let anything stop him. I just can&#39;t identify with that kind of work ethic.

Now in 1988 there&#39;s me. ...The acme of evolution. Hobbes: Oh, please.

Get out right now! Into the tub!  Let&#39;s go!!  Calvin:  She&#39;d have never found me if I hadn&#39;t sneezed.  I&#39;ll give you a quarter to take my bath for me.  Hobbes:  Let&#39;s see the quarter first.  Calvin:  Here.  Just splash around while I make it sound as if it&#39;s me in the tub.  Hobbes:  Ok, it&#39;s a deal.  In fact, for another 25 cents, I&#39;ll take your Wednesday bath, too.  Calvin:  Wow!  Really?? I could never take a  bath again!  Hobbes:  La de da da dum dum.  Calvin:  I&#39;m washing my arms now!  Whoops!  Dropped the soap! Now I&#39;m washing my face!  Ok, you can come out now.  That&#39;s long enough.  Hobbes:  Boy, that was easy. A few weeks of this and I&#39;ll be rich!  Calvin:  Not so long with the dryer, Mom will get suspicious.  Hobbes:  I&#39;m not all dry yet.  Calvin:  There!  We made it!  Now keep a straight face.  Mom:  Good night.  Give me a kiss.  Blechh!  You&#39;re filthy!  Calvin: Didn&#39;t you hear me take my bath?? See?  My towel is wet!  See?  See?  I want my quarter back.  Hobbes:  Forget it.

Calvin: Dad told me to go outside, so I&#39;m digging a hole to china. If Dad&#39;s going to be such a grouch, I figure I&#39;ll just go live on the other side of the planet. You can come too if you want. There&#39;s another shovel in the garage. You don&#39;t think your Dad will get mad about us digging us the driveway. Calvin: Oh, you know Dad.

If you&#39;ll help me, I&#39;ll be done faster. What&#39;s five plus seven? Hobbes: I don&#39;t know. Calvin: I don&#39;t either. Hobbes: Then write, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Calvin: Hey, that&#39;s a true answer, isn&#39;t it! I can write that for all of these! We&#39;re done! Parent: We&#39;d better have  a look at our prodigy&#39;s homework.

Calvin: No. I&#39;m watching TV. Hobbes: You hate this show. Let&#39;s go out. Calvin: Nah. Hobbes: Why not? Calvin: Dad finally said he was sick of arguing with me, and for all he cared, I could watch TV until my brains oozed out my ears. Hobbes: So you&#39;re going to? Calvin: It was a hard-won privilege.

Fuel...check. Landing gear...check. Goggles...check. Calvin pilots his F-15 at more than 1,500 miles an hour. Loaded with tons of every conceivable missle, the jet shrieks low over the ground! Up and over the next rise, his target comes into view! Calvin FIRES! Missle after missle streaks ahead and detonates with grim accuracy! Mission accomplished! A smoldering crater is all that remains of Calvin&#39;s elementary school!  SIGH...

It seems you&#39;re just not likeable enough. Those polled continue to find you a cold fish. If you want some advice, I&#39;d suggest you do something extraordinarily likeable in the next two minutes. Dad: Go to bed. Calvin: No, no! It&#39;s way too late to learn how to tell jokes.

You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to get up on these cold, dark mornings and have to go someplace you hate. Hobbes: Yes I do. Calvin: Oh yeah? How could you? Hobbes: You tell me every morning.

Hobbes: OK! Calvin: Look ferocious. Hobbes: How&#39;s this? Calvin: That&#39;s great. Hold still, now. Hmm...mm...AARGH! This isn&#39;t coming out good at all! I can&#39;t draw tigers! I hate this class! Hobbes: Here, let me try. The good thing about drawing a tiger is that it automatically makes your picture fine art. Calvin: Hey, that&#39;s pretty good! Put some human heads around him, as if he just ate a village. Hobbes: How&#39;s that? Calvin: Boy, this is great! I&#39;ll have the best picture in the whole class! I can&#39;t wait to show everyone! WOW! Thanks, Hobbes! (To principal): But I&#39;m not lying! My tiger drew it! Do you think I could draw something that good myself?? Principal: Yes...

Calvin: Get your kicks now, you glandular freak, because once you grow up you can&#39;t go beating people up for no reason! Moe: Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right. That really wasn&#39;t what I meant at all.

Susie: I got an &quot;A.&quot; Calvin: Really? Boy, I&#39;d hate to be you. I got a &quot;C.&quot; Susie: Why on earth would you rather get a &quot;C&quot; than an &quot;A&quot;?! Calvin: I find my life is a lot easier the lower I keep everyone&#39;s expectations.

Mom: Your Dad&#39;s going to take your picture. Hold still. Calvin: I don&#39;t want to get my picture taken! Mom: It will just take a few minutes. We&#39;re going to put the picture of you in our christmas cards so everyone can see what you look like now. Calvin: What a dumb idea. Why are we doing that? Dad: So we won&#39;t have relatives dropping by to visit. Mom: Dear...

Hobbes: I don&#39;t know. How can you tell without looking? Calvin: One way is to tell a story about a little kid getting mauled and eaten alive. Hobbes: How does that tell you if you have monsters? Calvin: Sometimes they laugh.

Three months is plenty! Look at me. I&#39;m smart! I don&#39;t need 11 1/2 more years of school! It&#39;s a complete waste of my time! Hobbes: How on earth did you get all the way to the bus stop with both feet through one pant let? Calvin: I fell down a lot. ...Why? What&#39;s your point? Hobbes: Nothing. I was just curious.

You&#39;re using chunky peanut butter, right? I won&#39;t eat smooth! Make it an open face sandwich, too! Don&#39;t put any jelly on it or anything! And use some normal bread! I don&#39;t like those weird grain breads! Did you cut it diagonally? I like triangles, so be sure to cut it right! Mom: Your majesty&#39;s sandwich. Calvin: Hey, this is a closed-face, horizontally cut, smooth peanut butter sandwich on weird bread with jelly! Weren&#39;t you listening?!

The waters boiling! I&#39;ll scald myself! What are you trying to do, cook me alive?? Well, forget it! I&#39;m not getting in! Mom: By the time you quit fussing, complaining, yelling and screaming, and actually take off your clothes and get in, the water will be perfect! Calvin: Boy, does she know me.

Hobbes: You bet! I brought these charred rocks and ashes from my backyard. See? Dramatic proof that UFOs landed not a hundred feet from my house! Their retro rockets burned solid rock into this fragile gray dust cube! Susie: This is an old charcoal briquette. Calvin: Even as we speak, aliens are undoubtedly infiltrating the highest levels of our government.

Is it better to hold fast and never come back down, or to compromise? I suppose it&#39;s best to hold fast when you can, and compromise when you need to. Calvin: That&#39;s a lot more mature than I think I care to be.

Calvin: As far as I&#39;m concerned, if something is so complicated that you can&#39;t explain it in 10 seconds, then it&#39;s probably not worth know anyway. My time is valuable. I can&#39;t go thinking about one subject for minutes on end. I&#39;m a busy man. Hobbes: ...Who&#39;s been sitting here for three hours. Calvin: ...At six thoughts a minute.

Dad: &quot;The zebra&#39;s stripes are lacking hues, so they don&#39;t compare to you-know-whose.&quot; &quot;Orange, black and white is what to wear! It&#39;s haute couture for those who dare!

I think he&#39;s crazy. I hate waiting for things. I like to have everything immediately. I can&#39;t think of anything I&#39;d rather anticipate than have right away. Can you? Hobbes: Death comes to mind. Calvin: I don&#39;t know why I bother trying to have a little discussion with you when you&#39;re always so morbid.

That wouldn&#39;t be good. I wish it snowed in the summer. Wouldn&#39;t that be fun? ..Well, no, actually that would make it hard to run when you play baseball. Heck, it&#39;s ok just the way it is. Hobbes: We&#39;re glad you approve.

I could order an official chocolate frosted sugar bombs beanie! See, it has a battery powered propeller on top and a big star on the front! Isn&#39;t that neat? Hobbes: You have to send in four box &quot;proof of purchase seals&quot; to get it, it says. Calvin: Well, don&#39;t just stand there, or this&#39;ll take forever. Hobbes: Ugh, This stuff always makes my heart skip.

I feel sick. Calvin: Ok, c&#39;mon that&#39;s only your second bowl of cereal. Hobbes: This stuff is pure sugar. Calvin: But it&#39;s fortified with eight essential vitamins, so it&#39;s good for you. Hobbes: Give me a break, this is like eating a bowl or milk duds. Calvin: Look, it says right on the box, &quot;Part of a wholesome, nutritious, balanced breakfast.&quot; Hobbes: And they show a guy eating five grapefruits, a dozen bran muffins... Calvin :You know why you shake like that? Vitamin deficiency, I&#39;ll bet.

How&#39;s your breakfast? Dad: Fine. Calvin: Oatmeal, huh? A bowl of pasty, bland, colorless sludge. Dad: Yes, why dont&#39; you go describe your own food somewhere else? Calvin: I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d rather have a bowl of tasty, lip-smacking, crunchy-on-the-outside, chewy-on-the-inside, choclate frosted sugar bombs! Can I pour you some? Dad: No thanks, I&#39;m trying to reach middle age. Calvin: What are you having, Mom? Boring old toast and tea? Mom: You want the beanie, you eat the cereal, Calvin.

Man, I&#39;m earning this.

I ate enough boxes of cereal to get all the proof or purchase seals I need! Now I can order my beanie! Oh, boy! I can&#39;t wait to get it! I&#39;ll be so cool! Hobbes: Not for over a month. It says to allow six weeks for delivery. Calvin: Six weeks?!? I&#39;ll be old then! Hobbes: And I&quot;m sure you&#39;re beanie will be the talk of the rest home.

It&#39;s like trying to enjoy your last meal before execution. A penny for your thoughts. Hobbes: Sorry. My thoughts are a buck apiece. Calvin: A dollar?! That&#39;s outrageous! Your thoughts aren&#39;t worth that! Hobbes: This one is! At a dollar, it&#39;s the bargain of a lifetime. Calvin: I wouldn&#39;t pay a nickle for any thought you&#39;ve ever had in your whole flea-ridden existence! Hobbes: That little remark just made the price ten dollars! Calvin: Ten?? YOu can&#39; extort me! Keep your stuped thought! Hobbes: If you knew what is was, you&#39;d beg to pay ten bucks for it. Calvin: C&#39;mon. Just tell me what it is, will you? Hobbes: Nothing doing, Pal. Calvin: Ok, ok! I&#39;ll give you 25 cents. That&#39;s all I have. Hobbes: Let&#39;s see it. Calvin: Here! 25 cents! Now what&#39;s this big expensive thought of yours?!

I hope it comes soon. Do you think it will? It&#39;s probably been almost six weeks by now, don&#39;t you think? I ordered the red beanie but what if it&#39;s not in stock? Should I take the blue one, or wait for them to reorder? A blue one would be OK, I guess, but I sure hope they have a red ome. I&#39;ve always wanted a beanie like this, with a propeller. Boy, it&#39;ll be so cool when I have it. I can&#39;t wait. Wow! A red beanie! ...Or a blue one. Do you think it will come tomoroow? Do you? Hobbes: It had sure better. Calvin: Yeah, that&#39;s how I feel, too.

I promise I won&#39;t ever be bad again! I&#39;ll do whatever you want! Please, please, please! I&#39;ll never ask another favor if today&#39;s the day I get my beanie! Did I get my beanie? Mom: Nope. Calvin: What&#39;s it take, huh?!

Every day I get all my hopes up, thinking my beanie will come..and then it doesn&#39;t. And for each day that goes by, I figure then odds are better that it will come the next day, so my hopes get higher and higher before they fall. It&#39;s awful. But I&#39;ve been disappointed so often, now, I&#39;m finally getting numb to it. Hobbes: Maybe the mailman made a second trip today and delivered it in the last five minutes. Calvin: Wow! I never thought of that! C&#39;mon! Hobbes: He&#39;s not numb.

I didn&#39;t get my propeller beanie today, did I? Mom: As a matter of fact, you did! Calvin: It&#39;s here! Ha ha! It took weeks and weeks of waiting, but at long last it&#39;s here!

Hobbes: Nope. That&#39;s one of the perks of being peral. Calvin: I&#39;m not having enough fun right now. Hobbes: You&#39;re not? Calvin: I&#39;m just having a little bit of fun. I should be having lots of fun. It&#39;s Sunday. I&#39;ve jsut got a few precious hours of freedom left before I have to go to school tomorrow. Calvin: Between now and bedtime, I have to squeeze all the fun possibel out of every minute! I don&#39;t want to wast a second of liberty! Each moment I should be able to say, &quot;I&#39;m having the time of my life right now!&quot; But here I am, and I&#39;m not having the time of my life! Valuable minutes are dissappearing forever, even as we speak! We&#39;ve got to have more fun! C&#39;mon! HObbes: I didn&#39;t realize fun was so much work. Calvin: Sure! When your serious about having fun, it&#39;s not much fun at all!

I&#39;ve got to assemble my beanie porpeller and motor myself! What do they think I am, an engineer? Look, I&#39;ve got to insert these wires and this plastic switch! I can&#39;t do this! Hobbes: Here. Let me try. Calvin: No! Get away! I&#39;ll do it! You&#39;d probably goof it all up, or... Oh no! Hobbes: See? Insult a tiger and you get bad luck! Every time!

The piece snapped! Now my beanie propeller wont work! AAghhghhh! I waited weeks for this and now it&#39;s broken, and I didn&#39;t even get to wear it! Stupid rotten piece of lousy junk!! It&#39;s all your fault! Rrghhghhgh! Hobbes: My fault! I was just sitting here! You broke it! Calvin: You willed me to break it! you did some subliminal thing! Don&#39;t deny it! I know you did! You must have! Hobbes: Ok, now I&#39;m willing you to go jump in the septig tank.

Calvin: Get away from me! I don&#39;t even want to talk to you! Hobbes: You broke you beanie moror, not me! I didn&#39;t do anything! Calvin: You distracted me! Hobbes: I did not! I was just sitting here! You broke it all by yourself! Calvin: *sniff* *sniffle* ...all right... I know... But considering my life&#39;s in shambles right now, couldn&#39;t you at least take the blame?

I broke the propeller motor trying to put it together. Dad: Well, let&#39;s see. This isn&#39;t too bad. You just snapped the battery case. I&#39;ll just glue it together and insert the switch for you, Ok? There! Good as new! Now just let this sit awhile so the glue can set. Calvin: You did it! You fixed it! I can&#39;t believe it! Hey, Mom! Dad fixed something! Mom: He did?? Your Dad?? Dad: All right! That&#39;s enough!

Dad fixed my beanie! Well? How&#39;s it look? Hobbes: Adjectives fail me. Calvin: I&#39;m turning it on. Ready? Here goes. I don&#39;t seem to be lifting off. This is very peculiar. Hobbes: That&#39;s the word I was looking for.

This beanie doesn&#39;t make me fly! What&#39;s the point of a propeller beanie if you can&#39;t even fly when you wear it?! Hobbes: Not &quot;style,&quot; certainly. Calvin: What a rip-off! I ate all that cereal, waited weeks and weeks to get the beanie, assemblet it myself, and the dumb thing doesn&#39;t even fly! At least it&#39;s not a total loss. It came in this great cardboard box. Hobbes: Oh, boy! Now we&#39;ll have some fun!

Mom: Well, you have to, whether you don&#39;t want to or not, so let&#39;s move. For your information, I don&#39;t have to do anything I don&#39;t want to do. Mom: Is that so?

I don&#39;t want to go to school. I don&#39;t want to be here at all. I&#39;m sick of everyone telling me what to do all the time! I hate my life! I hate everything! I wish I was dead! ...Well, No, I don&#39;t. Not really. I wish everyone else was dead.

How could you have possibly forgotten it, anyway?! It&#39;s all the class has been doing! Where have you been?? Don&#39;t you pay attention?!

It&#39;s hopeless. Calvin: There&#39;s a bug! Susie: You&#39;re wasting your time! The teacher is going to know you didn&#39;t spend any time on this insect collection. Calvin: Stall the bus driver.

Susie: Calvin, there is no way you&#39;re going to complete an insect collection on the way to school! Forget it! Calvin: Sighhh...well, maybe you&#39;re right. How much do you want for your collection? I&#39;ll give you a quarter...or here, 30 cents. Susie: I spent a month on this!

Worms are bugs, aren&#39;t they? Susie: Eww gross, Calvin! That&#39;s been floating in a puddle for days. Calvin: Class doesn&#39;t start for 10 minutes. If I can catch five bugs a minute, I&#39;ll get an &quot;A&quot; on my collection. See, I&#39;m off to a good start. Susie: Five bugs a minute?! You&#39;re out of your mind. Calvin: Here&#39;s another already. Susie: That&#39;s a little ball of lint! Calvin: Like I&#39;m sure the teacher&#39;s going to look real close at every hairy bug in 30 kids&#39; collections!

We&#39;ve got to go to class. Calvin: Rats. I didn&#39;t get 50 bugs yet. Susie: What do you have? Calvin: One drowned worm, a piece of fuzz lint that looks like a bug, a live ant, and a smashed fly. Susie: Well, if you label them scientifically in the next 30 seconds, maybe you&#39;ll get an &quot;F+.&quot; Calvin: We&#39;ve got to label these too?!? I was just going to put them all in an envelope. Susie: Actually I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way you&#39;ll get an &quot;F+.&quot; Calvin: For all this work, I&#39;d better at least get a &quot;D.&quot;

Susie: In this box with pins. Calvin: Hmm... I don&#39;t have a box or pins. I guess I&#39;ll just stilck my bugs on notebook paper. Oops. Tape doesn&#39;t work too well. Gross. I hope I can get him back together. Calvin: Can I borrow your paste? Susie: The way you&#39;re going, maybe you&#39;d prefer a stapler.

Help me think up scientific names of my bugs while this teacher&#39;s not looking. Susie: Shhh! We&#39;re not supposed to talk in class. Do it yourself. Miss Wormwood: Having a pleasant conversation, Miss Derkins? Susie: Eeep! Miss Wormwood: Perhaps you&#39;d like to sit up front, so you won&#39;t distract Calvin anymore. Calvin: Oh. I tried to get her to be quiet, but you know how girls are.

I hate him! I hate him! He&#39;s the one who didn&#39;t do the assignment! He&#39;s the one who was talking in class! He&#39;s the one who should be sitting here at the front of the room, not me! I wasn&#39;t doing anything wrong, but I&#39;m the one who got in trouble! I sure hope Calvin feels terrible about this! Calvin (writing): Hey Susie, How&#39;s the view way up there? Ha! Ha! Calvin. P.S. Try to steal a chalkboard eraser for me.

Miss Wormwood: Since Calvin seens to be enjoying the lesson, let&#39;s have him demonstrate the next problem. Calvin: Zounds! A zok death sloop appears out of nowhere and fries Spiff&#39;s stabilixers! Our hero hursl out of control toward his imminent doom! The situation desperate! This could be the end! What can our hero do?!? His mind racing furiously, Spiff springs into action! He downshifts his spacecraft and... ...stalls. Oh, darn, out of time. Once again Spaceman Spiff beats all odds to save the day!

I&#39;ve been sent to the principal! This is all Calvin&#39;s fault! He&#39;s the one who got me in all this trouble! I&#39;m so scared! What am I going to do?? I think they make the hall to the principal&#39;s office this big on purpose.

She&#39;s in trouble right now, all right! *Wheww* I sure was lucky the teacher blamed Susie for everything. What a break! Oh, no! What if Susie rats on me!? Suppose they make her sing! Suppose she squeals! Suppose she fingers me! Susie: Oh, I&#39;m so relieved. I was afraid you wouldn&#39;t believe me. Principal: Oh, yes, we&#39;ve got quite a file on our friend Calvin.

Boy, does she look pale. I wonder what happened. She&#39;s talking to the teacher right now. Psst! Susie, what did they do to you? Did you get expelled? You didn&#39;t snitch on me, did you? You did snitch! You&#39;re a stoolie! A canary! Susie: You&#39;re going up the river, Calvin. Teacher: Calvin, will you come here, please?

Then I got in trouble for getting Susie in trouble when I wanted her to help me fudge the project. Then I get in trouble when I told Mom, and then I got in trouble again when she told Dad! I&#39;ve been in hot water ever since I got up? Hobbes: Wow. I&#39;ll bet all this makes you get your book report finished right on time. Calvin: My what?

There are always a million distractions out here. I don&#39;t believe in ethics anymore. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the ends justify the means. Get what you can while the getting&#39;s good --- that&#39;s what I say! Might makes right! The winners write the history books! It&#39;s a dog-eat-dog world, so i&#39;ll do whatever I have to, and let others argue about whether it&#39;s &quot;right&quot; or not. Heyy! Why&#39;d you do that?!? Hobbes: You were in my way, now your not. the ends justify the means. Calvin: I didn&#39;t mean for everyone, you dolt! Just me! Hobbes: Ahh...

Dad! Outer space aliens just landed in the back yard! Dad: Oh really. What do they look like? Calvin: Sort of like big baked potatoes with laser guns. I think we should do what they say. Dad: DId they say what they want? Calvin: Yeah, they want 10 dollars. Dad; I&#39;ll bet they do. Calvin: Since you&#39;re so busy, you can just give the money to me, and I&#39;ll take it over to them.

Dad: Tonight&#39;s story is called, &quot;Why Prince Charming Stayed Single.&quot; Mom: Prince what?

Suppose I grow up to be one of the world&#39;s greatest men of all time. Suppose my name will be an inspiration to humanity for eons to come. What will the history books say? They&#39;ll say, &quot;Much of his childhood was spent unwillingly in the bathtub.&quot; What an indigniy this bath is! Is this situation worthy of one of the greatest men of all time?!? My likely historical significance is a terrivle burden. Would you rather they said your childhood was dirty and smelly?

Drinking from the far side of a glass is supposed to cure hiccups. Calvin: The (hic) far side of (hic) the glass? (hic) How do I (hic) do that? Hobbes: You have to bend your head way over. Calvin: Oh (hic) I see. (hic) Thanks. Now I&#39;ve got the hiccups and water up my nose. Hobes: I think most hiccup cures were really invented for the amusement of the patient&#39;s friends.

Mom: My friends ask me how I stay so thin.

I think nighttime is dark so you can imagine your fears with less distraction. At nighttime, the world always seems so big and scary, and I always seem so small. I wish I could fall asleep, so it would be morning. Sighhhhh...Look at Hobbes. He&#39;s asleep. Hobbes: Z Calvin: Heh heh...He sure looks funny when he sleeps. Tigers close their eyes so tight. I wonder what he&#39;s dreaming about. Good ol&#39; Hobbes. What a friend. Hobbes: Z Calvin: Things are never quite as scary when you&#39;ve got a best friend. Hobbes: Z Calvin: Z Hobbes: Z

We forgot Hobbes! Stop the car! Dad: We can&#39;t turn around, Calvin. We&#39;re late already. Calvin: But Da-ad!! Dad: You could&#39;ve been ready on tome and had all your things together, but you put up a fuss about going, made us late, and you forgot your tiger. It&#39;s your own fault. Calvin: You&#39;d turn around if we&#39;d forgotten Mom! Dad: That&#39;s because she&#39;s the only one who know where this place is. Mom: Har har.

I don&#39;t even know these people. This would be a lot more fun if Hobbes was here. I can&#39;t believe we left him at home. I hope he&#39;s Ok. What&#39;s he going to eat? We didn&#39;t leave any food out. And we&#39;ll be gone almost two whole days! Hobbes will be starving! I think I&#39;ll let Dad go in the house first.

Mom: Don&#39;t play with the phone, Calvin. Who on earth do you want to call? Calvin: Hobbes. I want to make sure he&#39;s Ok. Mom: Hobbes isn&#39;t going to answer the phone. Don&#39;t be silly. You&#39;ll see him tomorrow. Calvin: But he&#39;s probably all lonely! Mom: I&#39;m sure he&#39;s having a good time. Calvin: I hope he isn&#39;t renting some movie that I wanted to see.

Mom: I&#39;m sure you can if you just lie quietly. Calvin: But, Hobbes isn&#39;t here. Tigers are very comforting. I always fall right asleep when I listen to Hobbes breathing. Mom: Well, you can listen to your dad snoring. Calvin: That&#39;s Dad? I thought those were trucks down-shifting on the highway.

Calvin: Hoorayy! Now I get to see Hobbes! Mom: Boy, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d ever get home. The whole trip was one long complaint about leaving Hobbes behind. Dad: Next time we should take the tiger and forget the kid. Gosh it&#39;s drafty in here... Calvin: The window&#39;s smashed! Look at the glass! Mom: Somebody broke in!! Calvin: Hobbes! Find Hobbes!

I need more money. I wish people were more like animals. Animals don&#39;t try to change yoiu or make you fit in. They just enjoy the pleasure of you company. Animals aren&#39;t conditional about friendships. Animals like you just the way you are. They listen to your problems, they comfort you when you&#39;re sad, and all they ask in return is a little kindness. Hobbes: Whooonk! Sob. It&#39;s so...so true! Hoooot! Thbpbtpth!...and speaking of &quot;a little kindness.&quot; I&#39;d have a tuna fish sandwich any time soon, that you happen to make one... Calvin: Of course, some animals get on your nerves once in a while.

I don&#39;t think anyone would steal a stuffed tiger. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go look. Calvin: But Hobbes is so trusting...

Have you figured out what all is missing? Mom: No, we&#39;re looking for Hobbes. Calvin&#39;s almost hysterical. Dad: I feel a little hysterical myself. Mom: Ooh... I hope the police get here quick. I&#39;m scared. Dad: This is one of those things you always figure will happen to someone else. Mom: ...Unfortunately, we&#39;re all &quot;someone else&quot; to someone else.

Hobbes? Where are you?? I told Mom and Dad we left Hobbes behind...I tried to get them to turn around and come back...and now look, Hobbes was all alone when our house was broken into! Mom says Hobbes wouldn&#39;t have been stolen because he&#39;s not valuable. ...(sniff) Well, I think he&#39;s valuable.

You&#39;ve got to be somewhere! Mom: Here he is, Calvin! I found Hobbes! Calvin: You found him! Is he Ok? He&#39;s not hurt is he? Mom: He&#39;s fine. He was under the bed covers. Calvin: Hobbes, I&#39;m so glad to see you! you&#39;re safe and sound! (sniff) And now I am, too. Mom: It looks like we&#39;re a whole family again. Dad: Such as it is, yes.

Police officer: Do you happen to have the serial number? Calvin: I&#39;ll bet the burglars got scared off when they say there was a tiger in the house! Hobbes was here the whole time! Dad: Calvin, not now, Ok? I&#39;m busy. Calvin: Nobody stick around long when he sees a tiger, that&#39;s for sure! Mandibles of death, that&#39;s what Hobbes has! Dad: Right. Why don&#39;t you go tell your Mom? Calvin: Maybe Hobbes should look at mug shots. Can we got to the station and identify suspects? Huh, can we? Dad: Dear! Police officer: I sure meet the weirdos in this job...

Dad: Ok, I&#39;ll go get something to cover us the hole. Mom: Do you think it&#39;s safe to stay here tonight? Suppose the burglars come back! Dad: The police said they&#39;d drive by, and we&#39;ll leave lots of lights on. Mom: Ugh, it&#39;s so creepy knowing those goons have been in our house. I don&#39;t feel safe at all. Dad: I know. And this must be really scary for a little kid like Calvin. Calvin: Gosh, I can&#39;t wait to tell everyone at school how our house got robbed! Hobbes: Be sure to say who scared the burglars off after they took the TV and jewlery.

No one is watching! He dashes into his closet! This is a job for... Stupendous Man! Defender of Freedom! Advocate of liberty! A bright crimson streak blast up through the atmosphere. And then turns back toward Earth! Gaining stupendous momentum, Stupendous Man strikes the ground at an acute angle with supendous force! The Earth slowly stops rotating...and begins to turn in the opposite direction! Pushing with all his might Stupendous Man turns the planet all the way around backward! The sun sets in the East and rises in the West! Soon it&#39;s 10 A.M. the previous day! Mom: What are you doing outside? Did you finish your homework already? Calvin: It&#39;s Saturday! I don&#39;t need to do it until tomorrow...thanks to Stupendous Man!

Mom: Yes, he&#39;s snuggled up with Hobbes. Dad: Boy, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m ever going to sleep. Mom: Me neither. I can&#39;t get over what&#39;s happened. The idea of some crazy stranger going through our house...brrrr! I wish I had a big stuffed animal to fell safe with. I guess you&#39;ll have to do. Dad: So what do I get to snuggel? How come I&#39;m the grown-up??

My heart jumps at the slightest sound. It&#39;s almost 2 and I&#39;m wide awake. When someone breaks into your home, it shatters your last illusion of security. If you&#39;re not safe in your own home, you&#39;re not safe anywhere. A man&#39;s home is his castle, but it shouldn&#39;t have to be a fortress.

Dad: Mmm-hmm. I was thinking. It&#39;s funny...when I was a kid, I thought grown-ups never worried about anything. I trusted my parents to take care of everything, and it never occurred to me that they might not know how. I figured that once you grew up, you automatically knew what to do in any given scenario. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have been in such a hurry to reach adulthood if I&#39;d know the whole thing was going to be ad-libbed.

No one was hurt. We&#39;re all together and Ok. We lost a few of our nice things, but things don&#39;t matter much really. It&#39;s hard to believe how often we forget that.

Mom: You didn&#39;t finish your dinner. Calvin: Well, I didn&#39;t like it very much, and there&#39;s this TV show I want to watch, so... Mom: Our TV was stolen, remember? Calvin: Gosh, I guess I&#39;ll eat my asparagus, do my homework, and go straight to bed, then. Mom: And we&#39;re so proud of how you handle adversity.

Calvin: But we don&#39;t have a TV anymore. Now we have a bland wall to watch. So here I am not being entertained. Hobbes: A pointless existence, huh? Calvin: I mean, the wall is even plain old white!

Let me count the ways: One...number one... Hmm... Nummmber one... mm.. Hey Mom, wake up! I made you a Mother&#39;s Day card! Mom: Why, how sweet of you! Calvin: I did it all by myself. Go ahead and read it! Mom: &quot;I was going to buy a card with hearts of pink and red, but then I thought I&#39;d rather spend the money on me, instead. It&#39;s awfully hard to buy things when one&#39;s allowance is so small... Calvin: Ahem... Mom: ...So I guess you&#39;re pretty lucky I got you anything at all. Happy Mother&#39;s Day to you. There, I said it. Now I&#39;m done. So how &#39;bout getting out of bed and cooking breakfast for your son? I&#39;m deeply moved. Calvin: Did you notice the part about my allowence?

I&#39;m starting a secret club, and you can be in it! Hobbes: Oh, boy! Calvin: It&#39;ll be great! We&#39;ll think of secret names for ourselves, secret codes for our secret correspondence, a secret handshake... We&#39;ll have a secret clubhouse with a secret knock to get in, and we&#39;ll do big secretive things! Hobbes: Why all the secrecy? Calvin: People pay more attention to you when they think you&#39;re up to something.

Hobbes: Let&#39;s call it &quot;The Hobbes fan club&quot;! Calvin: The Hobbes fan club?! Give me a break! I&#39;m sure!! This is a top-secret society! The name should be something mysterious! Something vaguely omnious and chilling! Calvin: Something like, &quot;The sinster icy black hand of death club&quot;! Hobbes: I still like my idea better.

We&#39;ll call our club G.R.O.S.S. - Get Rid Of Slimy girlS! That way, Susie Derkins can&#39;t join! Hobbes: Is she slimy? Calvin: All girls are slimy. Now the first order of business is to elect officers. Hobbes: I get to be president! Calvin: Oh, no you don&#39;t! This whole club was my idea, so I get to be president. Hobbes: Ok, then I get to be king and tyrant. Calvin: Hey, no! That&#39;s what I want to be! You can be president!

What are you doing, making paper hats? Can I make one, too? Calvin: Don&#39;t be ridiculous. This is the official chapeau of our top-secret club, G.R.O.S.S. - Get Rid Of Slimy girlS! Susie: &quot;Slimy girls&quot;?! Calvin: I know that&#39;s redundant, but otherwise it doesn&#39;t spell anything. Now go away. Susie: Girls aren&#39;t slimy! Calvin: Don&#39;t get gunk on me. I took a bath last Saturday and I&#39;m all clean.

There&#39;s nothing wrong with girls! Calvin: See, Hobbes? Girls are so emotional. Susie: You&#39;re the meanest, most rotten little kid I know! Well, fine! Play with your stuffed tiger! See what I care! I don&#39;t want to play with a stinker like you anyway!! Calvin: Wow, what a great club!

I know! We can set up a card table in the garage! That would be perfect for drawing up maps and stuff! Hmm. There&#39;s not much room with the car here. Let&#39;s push is into the drive. Hobbes: Shouldn&#39;t you ask your mom to move it instead? Calvin: Nahh. She won&#39;t care if we push it out. C&#39;mon. Hobbes: In the past you&#39;ve been a remarkably poor judge of what your mom cares about.

Here comes susie, just ignore her. Susie: Hi, Calvin, can i play with your tiger? Calvin: Hobbes and I are not playing. We&#39;re doing big important things, and we don&#39;t need you to mess them up. Susie: It doesn&#39;t look to me like you&#39;re doing anything so important. Calvin: Well we are so go away. We&#39;ve wasted too much time talking to you already.  Susie: you&#39;re just playing in the mud. Calvin: That&#39;s just what it looks like to ignorant girls like you! Get lost! Susie: All right, you litte creep! I don&#39;t need you! I&#39;ve got better things to do that sit in the mud like a pig! Calvin: A pig?! By golly, I&#39;ll show you! Susie: Don&#39;t bend over! Your curly pink tail shows! oink! oink! oink! oink! Calvin: Eat some mud, Susie! Susie: Ha HA! you missed! oink! oink! oink! HobbesL Ahhh spring! That magical time of year when a young mans fancy turns to love! Calvin: Shut up.

I can&#39;t budge it by myself. Hobbes: I still think you should ask your mom to move it. Calvin: Then she&#39;d probably say no, and we won&#39;t have the garage for our clubhouse! Hobbes: But if we don&#39;t ask her, we&#39;ll get in trouble. Calvin: We won&#39;t get in trouble! Hobbes: Every time you say that, we do. Calvin: Mom wouldn&#39;t care about these things if she wouldn&#39;t keep finding out about them.

We&#39;ll move it 10 feet. What could possibly go wrong?! Hobbes: Whenever you ask that, my tail gets all bushy. Calvin: Oh, knock it off, mom will be glad we did this ourselves and didn&#39;t bother her. Hobbes: Well, she does hate to be bothered. Calvin: Right, now push! Push! calvin: Hey, the cars not stopping! Stop! Stop! Hobbes: I think your mom&#39;s going to be bothered.

It&#39;s still rolling! Hobbes: The driveway must be slanted downhill! Calvin: It&#39;s going faster! Whoa! Whoa! Hobbes: Jump in and pull the emergency brake! Calvin: I can&#39;t catch the door! Oh, no! Oh, no! Hobbes: It&#39;s going to go into the road! Don&#39;t follow it! Calvin: Look out! Wild car!!

Hobbes: No. Calvin: Gosh, what was yesterday like? I think life should  be more like TV. I think all of life&#39;s problems ought to be solved in 30 minutes with simple homiles, don&#39;t you? I think weight and oral hygiene ought to be our biggest concerns. I think we should all have powerful, high-paying jobs, and everyone should drive fancy sports cars. All our desires should be instantly gratified. Women should always wear tight clothes, and men should carry powerful hand guns, Life overall should be more glamorous, thrill-packed, and filled with applause, don&#39;t you think? Hobbes: I think My life is too featherbrained already. Calvin: Of course, if life was really like that, what would we watch on TV?

We&#39;ll never get the car out of the ravine. Should we act surprised, like the car just rolled here by itself? Maybe Mom and Dad would fall for that. Or maybe they won&#39;t even notice if we just don&#39;t say anything, you think? Hobbes: I can be packed in five minutes. Calvin: Ok, I&#39;ll try to get the maps out of the glove compartment.

Hobbes and I are back! Do I have any clean clothes? I mean, I&#39;m just wondering! I&#39;m going to make myself a few dozen sandwhiches! Uh...I&#39;m really hungry! Calvin: No need to get up, or look, for example, out the window! just stay where you are for another 10 minutes! Mom: What&#39;s the matter with you? Calvin: Aaugh! Ha ha ha ha! Nothing! Uh, why do  you ask??

Are you packed? We&#39;d better go! Should I take the yo-yo or the bubbles? ...Or both? Calvin: Hobbes, come on! We&#39;ll be lucky to get out of here with our lives! Mom&#39;s bound to look outside any minute now and see the car in the ditch! If we&#39;re not in the next country by then, it&#39;s curtains! Let&#39;s go! Where&#39;s a freight train when you really need one?

I think we&#39;ve got enough of a head start. We can rest a minute. Hobbes: Do you think your mom has seen the car by now? Calvin: Probably.

Let&#39;s stop here. Boy, it never once occurred to me that I&#39;d be spending the rest of my life on the lam. Hobbes: Speaking of lamb, what kind of sanwiches did you bring? Calvin: How can you think of eating? I&#39;m so worried. I feel sick. Hobbes: Really? Can I have your sandwich too? Calvin: Six year old and a fugitive from justice. I can&#39;t believe it.

Something is seriously wrong here. The laws of perpective have been repealed! Objects no longer diminish in size with distance! Lines do not converge toward any point on the horizon! All spatual relationships are lost! It&#39;s impossible to judge where anything is! oh no! Mom: Calvin,  quit running around and crashing into things, or I&#39;ll sell you to the monkey house! Calvin: ...and now she&#39;s lost perspective.

I wonder. Why are all those cars slowing down as they go by? Gosh, did someone have an accident? It looks like there&#39;s a car in the ditch! ...But I don&#39;t see anyone by it. And how on earth did they go straight in backward? To do that, the car would&#39;ve ahd to come... ...right...out...our...driveway!

Hobbes: I don&#39;t hear anything. Hobbes: There! Something is crashing through the brush! Calvin: It sounds big! Maybe it&#39;s a bear! Hobbes: There are bears out here?? Calvin: Climb the tree! Climb the tree! Hobbes: If you ask me, tigers are the only ferocious animals the world really needs. Calvin: &quot;Boy, 6, killed by bear! Parents saved the trouble.&quot;

Should we climb higher? Hobbes: It&#39;s hard to say with bears. calvin: There it is! The bear&#39;s coming out of the brush! Oh no! It looks like it&#39;s on it&#39;s hind legs! Bears stand up when they&#39;re really mad!! Hobbes: Wait, that&#39;s not a bear. That&#39;s your mom! Calvin: Aaugh! Even worse! Climb higher! Climb higher!

Come down here so I can talk to you. Calvin: No. You&#39;ll kill us. We&#39;re running away. Mom: I&#39;m not going to kill you. I just want to find out what happened. Are you Ok? Was anyone hurt? Calvin: No one was hurt. We were pushing the car into the drive and it kept rolling. Mom: The car didn&#39;t hit anything? Calvin: It just went across the road and into the ditch. That&#39;s when we took off. Mom: Well, the tow truck pulled it out, and there&#39;s no damage so you can come home now. Calvin: First let&#39;s hear you say you love me.

Mom and Dad saw right away that what happened to the car was an accident. They were so relieved no one got hurt that all we got was a lecture on safety and asking permission. They didn&#39;t even raise their voices. Parents are sure inscrutable, huh? Send their car over a ditch and you don&#39;t even get yelled at. Hobbes: ...But try keeping live worms in your dad&#39;s... Calvin: Let&#39;s not talk about that, Ok?!

An overwhelming majority express amazement at how little you&#39;ve accomplished as Dad so far. The mipression is that you&#39;re avoiding all the hard decisions that need to be made. In fact, none of those polled could name a single insance of true paternal leadership. Dad: How about if I lead you upstairs to your bed? Calvin: Ha ha. If we can be serious for a moment, I have some innovative ideas about my allowance.

They&#39;re all running like mad, working tirelessly all day, never stopping, never resting. And for what? to build a tiny little hill of sand that could be wiped out at any moment! All their work could be for nothing and yet they keep on building. They never give up! Hobbes: I suppose there&#39;s a lesson in that. Calvin: Yeah...ants are morons. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s on TV.

Calvin has turned into one of his own childhood drawings! His anatomical references being obscure at best, Calvin finds it difficult to move! Are these lower appendages feet or wheels? His own mom thinks he&#39;s some kind of helicopter! If only Calvin had learned to draw better! No one understands my work. Mom: That&#39;s what all artists say.

Then I aim with just one eye open, so I don&#39;t have any deapth perception. It&#39;s pretty hard that way. See, the secret to having fun in life is to make little challenges for yourself. Hobbes: Like the challenge of explaining the stove and floor to your mom? Calvin: Rats. See if there&#39;s another carton in the fridge, will ya?

Calvin: I&#39;m telling these companies I intend to boycott all their products if they don&#39;t pull their ads from a TV show I find offensive. By golly, if these companies are going to support objectional TV programs, I&#39;ll take my business elsewhere! Maybe I can scare away the advertising dollars and get the show cancelled. Hobbes: Why don&#39;t you just watch the show? Calvin: This clean wholesome television! Ughh, it makes me sick.

I bite off the bottom of the cone and suck out the ice cream as it gets soft. You wouldn&#39;t believe some of the awful noises you can make, and it gets pretty sloppy when the cone gets soggy and both ends start dripping. In my book, food should be nutrition and entertainment. Hobbes: That&#39;s why tigers like our food surprised and running.

I guess I&#39;m a child progeny. Hobbes: Most children are. Calvin: Huh? Hobbes: Nothing. Calvin: People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don&#39;t realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world. Hobbes: Isn&#39;t your pants zipper supposed to be in the front?

Heh heh heh! Calvin: While you have just one water balloon, I have three! I&#39;m a walking arsenal of hydro-weaponry! Calvin: Ha ha! I can see the fear in your eyes! You realize that I can get you three times wetter than you can get me! Calvin: Throw your balloon, and your utter sogginess is assured! I, on the other hand, can act with impunity! With three balloons, I fear nothing! Hobbes: Catch. Calvin: Hey! don&#39;t! My arms are full! Calvin: Oh no! Calvin: We super- powers have it tough. Hobbes: Maybe you should stock up on brains instead!

Let&#39;s get in the car. Hobbes: Where are we going? Calvin: The same place we go every summer: camping on some desolate rock at the end of the earth. Hobbes: Again? Clavin: Yep. This is how dad like to unwind. Hobbes: With everyone complaining? Calvin: Right. He likes to watch us all suffer.

See the sign? Why don&#39;t we pull off, find a nice motel and just stay there for our vacation? We could swim in the pool and have air conditioning and color cable TV and room service! No one would have to know we didn&#39;t camp! I wouldn&#39;t even tell anyone! We could even go to the store, but a big fish, take your picture with it, and say you caught it! Can&#39;t we, Dad? Can&#39;t we turn off here? Mom: Yes, let&#39;s! Dad: Now don&#39;t you start!

We&#39;re here! Calvin: Good ol&#39; &quot;Itchy Island.&quot; Home of the nuclear mosquitos. Dad: But bites build character. Calvin: Yeah, and last year you said diarrhea builds character. Dad: So think what a fine young amn you&#39;re growing up to be. Calvin: ...If all this character doesn&#39;t kill me first. Dad: That reminds me, open the duffel bag and get out the spam. Calvin: If the canoe isnt&#39; here in the morning, it means Hobbes and I struck out for home.

This is the life! I think I&#39;ll jump in for a swim. Want to join me? Mom: No, thanks. Dad: Aw, c&#39;mon. It&#39;ll feel great. Mom: Right. That lake couldn&#39;t have milted before yesterday. Dad: Hey, let&#39;s go for a swim! Calvin: Sure, Dad. I&#39;d love to start the week with a little hypothermia. Dad: I think what I like best about vacations is the family togetherness.

It&#39;s 5:30 and you can see the fish jumping. Calvin: Mmf. Goway. Dad: It&#39;s a beautiful morning. The sun&#39;s barely up and there&#39;s a mist over the water. It&#39;s perfectly still. Not a soul anywhere! Don&#39;t you want to see this? Calvin: Leemeelone. Dad: I thought you said you wanted to go fishing. You&#39;ve got top get up early if you want to catch anything. C&#39;mon, the canoe&#39;s all ready and I&#39;ve got your fishing rod. Calvin: Mom, make Dad go away! Dad: Another thing I like about summer vacations is the sharing of special moments.

Mmm, I can&#39;t wait to get back and have breakfast! I can almost smell the coffee from here! What a life! Hey, where is every... There&#39;s going to be a smallmouth bass flopping in some sleeping bags in a minute or two! Mom: You know. I really like it when you go off to work in the mornings. Dad: It&#39;s 6:30 already! Are you people going to waste the whole day?

A day at the lake! This will be great! Calvin: I still don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t just sit in the car with the air conditioner on. Calvin: I&#39;m getting sand in my suit! I don&#39;t want to sit on the beach! Calvin: This water&#39;s too cold! I&#39;m freezing to death! Calvin: Out here there&#39;s too much sun! I&#39;ll get sunburned! Calvin: This lotion makes me greasy and my shirt makes me too hot! Calvin: I don&#39;t want to sit in the shade! This is boring! Calvin: I hate walking! My legs are tired and the sand is too cold and there&#39;s no shade here and I&#39;ve still got sand in my suit! Calvin: What? Are we going already?

Calvin: Aaugh! Mom: I don&#39;t care what all your clothes smell like! I&#39;m not washing anything now! Go to bed!

I itch all over! Hobbes: Don&#39;t scratch the bites or you&#39;ll just make the itching worse. Calvin: What am I supposed to do then? It&#39;s driving me crazy! Hobbes: Think about something else. Calvin: Something else?! Like what?? Hobbes: Like maybe stepping out of all that poison ivy. Calvin: I hate this place!

Mom: Ack! Don&#39;t take a picture of me! I haven&#39;t washed my hair in three days and I&#39;m covered with bug bites! Dad: But don&#39;t you wnat something to remember our trip by? Calvin: I don&#39;t want to remember this trip! I&#39;ve been trying to forget it ever since we got there! When are we leaving this dump? Dad: The next time I see one of thes smarmy kodak commercials I&#39;m going to put an ax through the TV.

I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s time to go home so soon. After being out here, it will sure be a culture shock to go back to civilization, won&#39;t it? Calvin: Man, I can&#39;t wait to get in the car and crank up the A/C and some tunes. Shake a leg, huh? Dad: Someday I&#39;m going to get my DNA tested and see if he&#39;s really my kid. Mom: Take my word for it.

Dad: That&#39;s all the oxygen in the atmosphere catching fire. Calvin: Where does the sun go when it sets? Dad: The sun sets in the west. In Arizona actually, near Flagstaff. Calvin: Oh.  Dad:  That&#39;s why the rocks there are so red.  Calvin:  Don&#39;t the people get burned up?  Dad:  No, the sun goes out as it sets.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s dark at night.  Calvin: Doesn&#39;t the sun crush the whole state when it lands?  Dad:  Ha ha, of course not.  Hold a quarter up. See, the sun&#39;s just about the same size. Calvin:  I thought I read that the sun was really big. Dad: You can&#39;t believe everything you read, I&#39;m afraid.  Calvin:  So how does the sun rise in the east if it lands in Arizona each night!  Dad:  Well, time for bed.  Calvin:  I hope someday I&#39;m as smart as Dad is.  Mom:  Why, what did he tell you now?

Dad: Yep. Calvin: It sure is a nice day. The kind of day just made for sitting under a tree and reading a good novel cover to cover, don&#39;t you think? Too bad that&#39;s a luxury at your age. Well, maybe you can do it when you&#39;re 65. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be that old before you know it. Enjoy your day at work. Dad sure is surly in the mornings.

I don&#39;t remember much of anything until I was three years old. Half of my life is a complete blank! I must&#39;ve been brainwashed! Good heavens, what kind of sicko would brainwash an infant?! And what did I know that someone wanted me to forget?? Boy, am I mysterious. Hobbes: I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up.

It&#39;s true. Heaby matter, like planets, sinks into the surface and anything passing by, like light, will &quot;roll&quot; toward the dip in space made by the planet. Light is actually deflected by gravity! Amazing, huh? And speaking of gravity, I dropped a pitcher of lemonade on the kitchen floor when my roller skates slipped. Mom: How can kids know so much an still be so dumb?

There should just be fewer people and animals to begin with. And the world certainly could&#39;ve used a more even distribution of resources, that&#39;s for sure. Hobbes: I wonder why nobody consulted you. Calvin: Invredible, isn&#39;t it?

You know how maps always show north as up and south as down? I wanted to see if that was true or not. Dad: What did you find out? Calvin: Not much. Your compass didn&#39;t survive the trip south from the top of the tree. Dad: My compass?! Calvin: Let me know when you get a new one. My junior scientist book says not to get discouraged by temporary setbacks.

You know how boring Dad is? Maybe it&#39;s a big phony act! Maybe after he puts us to bed, Dad dons some weird costume and goes out fighting crime! Maybe this whole &quot;dad&quot; stuff is just a secret identity! Maybe the mayor calls Dad on a secret hot line whenever the city&#39;s in trouble! Maybe Dad&#39;s a masked superhero! Hobbes: If that&#39;s true, he should drive a cooler car. Calvin: I know. Ours doesn&#39;t even have a cassette deck.

Calvin: Slow. This dirt is really hard. Hobbes: Well, that&#39;s a pretty good start. Calvin: But I&#39;ve been digging all morning! This is going to take forever! Hobbes: Maybe you&#39;ll have to settle for a smaller swimming pool. Calvin: Yeah. This would kill you if you went off the high dive. It&#39;s too bad. Mom wouldn&#39;t really been surprised to have an olympic pool where her garden used to be. Hobbes: Maybe she&#39;ll be surprised anyway.

A full pitcher of &quot;Calvin&#39;s Curative Elixer&quot;! We&#39;ll charge people a buck a glass and get rich! Hobbes: But that just dirty water from the drainage ditch! There are leaves in it! Calvin: &quot;Fortified with clorophyll,&quot; we&#39;ll say. Hobbes: Nobody&#39;s going to pay to drink that! Anyone can see it&#39;s filthy! It&#39;s sludge! Calvin: Hmm... Maybe you&#39;re right.

I don&#39;t need an education. I don&#39;t need to learn things. i don&#39;t need to develop skills. It&#39;s too much trouble. Hobbes: how are you going to make it in the world if you don&#39;t know anything and you don&#39;t have any skills?! Calvin: I&#39;ll go on talk shows and hype myself.

All the maintenance! The walls need painting, the roof need to be fixed, the tree out back needs to be sprayed... It seems like the whole place is falling apart. ...And what isn&#39;t falling apart is being actively destroyed!

The Allosaurus, fearsome predator of the Jurassic, stalks his prey!  The herd of Brontosaurs is unaware of his presence! Spotting a straggler, the Allosaurus lunges! The Brontosaurus rears to its full gigantic height! What induces an Allosaurus to attack a monster more than twice his own size??  Calvin:  I&#39;m hungry!  Dad:  The hamburgers are cooking!  Now get off me!

Although small, he puts out tremendous energy. To hover, his wings beat hundreds of times each second! What fuels this incredible metabolism? Concentrated sugar water! He drinks half his weight a day! ...Preferably loaded with caffeine. Parent: Are you drinking more soda pop?!

Dad: What&#39;s the matter. Calvin: Has this book been a best seller? Has the author won a pulitzer? Did the New York Times like it? I only want stories that come highly recommended. Are there any laudatory quotes on the dust jacket? Dad: Ahem... &quot;Once upon a time there was a noisy kid who starting going to bed without a story.&quot; Calvin: Has this book been made into a movie? Could we be watching this on video?

Calvin: I&#39;m practicing my sneers. Calvin: There&#39;s nothing like a good sneer to dry up conversation. How&#39;s mine look? Hobbes: Awful! Calvin: Thanks. With this sneer, I hope to be an unbearable burden at any social occasion. Hobbes: That will give you a real head start on being a teenager. Calvin: I know! It&#39;s like getting seven extra years!

Calvin: Shh, Mom! Go away! Susie&#39;s coming down the walk and I&#39;m going to throw some crab apples at her. Mom: Oh, no, you&#39;re not! Put those down! Calvin: Awww, Mom! Mom: Don&#39;t throw crab apples at anyone. They&#39;re hard and you could really hurt someone. Calvin: Ok, ok. Susie: What are you doing down there, Calvin? Calvin: Shh, Susie! Go away! I&#39;m going to throw this squishy old tomato at my mom.

Calvin: You rotten fleabag!  I&#39;ll get you!  You hear, me??  Say your prayers!  Hobbes:  Ah, you&#39;re all wet!  Yuk! yuk!  Calvin:  By golly, I&#39;ll soak him with the hose!  He won&#39;t dry out for a month!  I&#39;ve got you now, Hobbes, ol&#39; buddy!  Heh heh heh! Trying to get another balloon ready, eh?  Well you&#39;re too late!  Hope you&#39;re thirsty, sucker!  Hey, what&#39;s wrong?!  This hose isn&#39;t working!  Why won&#39;t it squirt?!  Hobbes: Oh, I had to take this end off the faucet so I could fill my balloon.  Calvin:  Uh oh.  Actually, I&#39;m kind of looking forward to going to school next week.

Come help me, Ok? Hobbes: Ok. Calvin: You get some pencils, and I&#39;ll get some big paper! Hobbes: I thought we were making the bed. Calvin: And do all that work?!? No, we&#39;re going to invent a robot to make the bed for us! Hobbes: Won&#39;t inventing a robot be more work than making the bed? Calvin: It&#39;s only work if someone makes you do it.

We don&#39;t know anything about machines. Calvin: Maybe you don&#39;t. It&#39;s easy. There are just four simple machines to alter force: The lever, the pulley, the inclined plane and, um, the internal combustion engine. Take my word for it, I&#39;m an expert at inventions. Hobbes: So where do we start? Calvin: We ask mom for a research grant.

Can I look in your wallet for a few mintues? I, uh, want to see something. Mom: Hold on. Did you make your bed like I asked you? Calvin: I&#39;m working on it. Mom: As I recall, your bed is in your room. Calvin: I&#39;m inventing a robot to make the bed, but I need a grant. Can I have $50? Hobbes: What&#39;d she say? Did you get the money? Calvin: Boy, when we&#39;re the cover story of popular mechanics, I&#39;ll have some choice words to say about family encouragement.

Hobbes: Should we use a coffee can? Calvin: No, that&#39;s too small. The head has to hold this tape recorder. See, I&#39;be made recordings for the robot&#39;s voice! Hobbes: Really? Calvin: Sure! This way, our robot not oly communicates, but we can also &quot;program&quot; him to have the proper personality! Hobbes: Personality? Calvin: Right. Robots should be respectful. Tape recording: *click* How may I ease your life, oh grand exalted master?

Can you get me a patent? Dad: You invented a robot? Calvin: Well, here it is so far. Hobbes and I have been working on it all afternoon. It&#39;s not quite perfected yet, but you get the idea. Dad: Hmm...what does it do? Calvin: That&#39;s the problem. We haven&#39;t figured out how to make it do what we want. Dad: Don&#39;t get discouraged, your mom and I got the same results after working on you for six year. Calvin: Har har. My attourney is a comedian.

I can&#39;t figure out how to make a robot. This one doesn&#39;t do anything. Mom: It&#39;s past your bedtime, Calvin. You&#39;ll have to leave your toys for tomorrow. Calvin: Ok, Mom. Our robot wasn&#39;t working out anyway. Gosh, and we spent all day on it, too. I thought for sure our robot would save us from making the bed. Hobbes: And in a way he did! Calvin: Hey, yeah! We&#39;re geniuses!

Calvin:.Uh.. d..i..s....s..t..e..r. Miss Wormwood: Very good. I&#39;m glad you were paying attention. Calvin: Yes! Once again the incredible spaceman Spiff beats all odds to save the day!

Aren&#39;t you excited about going to school? Look at all these great school supplies I got! I love having new notebooks and stuff. Calvin: All I&#39;ve got to say is they&#39;re not making me learn any foreign languages! If english is good enough for me, then by golly, it&#39;s good enough for the rest of the world! Everyone should speak english or just shut up, that&#39;s what I say! Susie: You should maybe check the chemical content of your breakfast cereal. Calvin: They can make me go until grade eight, and then, ffft, I&#39;m outta here!

You&#39;re giving it to me because we&#39;ll both be so much happier that way. Calvin: How touching.

Calvin: So I only &quot;gave&quot; it to you because you&#39;re bigger than me! Moe: Yeah? ...So? Calvin: The forensic marvel has reduced my logic to shambles. Moe: You&#39;re saying you changed your mind about getting punched?

He won&#39;t give my truck back to me. The oaf will probably break it, too. Should I steal it back? I know stealing is wrong, but he stole it from me, and if I don&#39;t steal it back, Moe will just keep it, and that&#39;s not fair. They say two wrongs don&#39;t make a right, but what are you supposed to do then? Just let the biggest guy make his own rules all the time? Let might make right? ..That sounds reasonable.

It&#39;s mine and he has no right to have it! I&#39;ll just sneak up behind the swings here, and when Moe&#39;s not looking, I&#39;ll run up, grab the truck and take off! Thes playground should have one of those automatic insurance machines like they have in airports.

Now I&#39;ll zip over, steal my truck back and run like crazy! He&#39;ll never know what hit him! By the time he see&#39;s the truck is gone, I&#39;ll be a mile away! It&#39;s a fail-proof plan! Nothing can go wrong! It&#39;s a snap! There&#39;s no reason to hesitate. It&#39;ll be over in a split second, and I&#39;ll sure be glad to have my truck back! I&#39;ll just do it and be done! Nothing to it! It&#39;s easy! Obviously my body doesn&#39;t believe a word my brain is saying.

I&#39;d never get away with stealing my truck back from Moe. The ugly galoot is the size of a buick. Hmm...Since I can&#39;t fight him, maybe I should try talking to him, maybe if I reasoned with him, he&#39;d see my side. Maybe he&#39;d realize that stealing hurts people, and maybe he&#39;d return my truck willingly. Maybe if I&#39;m really lucky I won&#39;t go through my life with the nickname &quot;Omelet Face.&quot;

Moe: Ok, thanks! Heh heh. Boy: Hey, kid, if you&#39;re not goona swing, get off and let someone else on, huh?

I didn&#39;t want to fight, so I walked away and Moe kept my truck. I don&#39;t understand it, Hobbes. What makes some people so greedy and mean? Why is it that some people don&#39;t care what&#39;s wrong and right? Why don&#39;t people try to be nice to each other? Hobbes: The problem with people is that they&#39;re only human. Calvin: Well, you&#39;re lucky you don&#39;t have to be one.

Hobbes: That&#39;s why animals are so soft and huggy. Calvin: ...Yeah...

Momm! Mom: What is it? What&#39;s the matter? Calvin: Hobbes had a bad dream. Mom: You woke me up at 2 a.m. because you think your stuffed tiger had a bad dream?!? Calvin: He dreamed he was so hungry, he ate us all up. Mom: I must be having a bad dream. Calvin: Don&#39;t you think you should make Hobbes a sandwich, just in case?

At the fresh fish counter in the supermarket, you can buy real squid. They have them in a bucket. They&#39;re really gross. Dad: Mm, I&#39;ll bet. Calvin, what are you doing?

They&#39;re the toast of the town. Life&#39;s always better when a tiger&#39;s around! Considering I outrank you, I don&#39;t think I should have to do that! This meeting of the top-secret club G.R.O.S.S (Get rid of slimy girls) will come to order. Supreme dictator for life, Calvin, presiding. All salute! Ok, the first order of business.  President, no first tiger Hobbes will read the minutes of our last meeting. Hobbes: Thank you. 10:30am: read minutes of previous meeting, 10:31: debated so called &quot;editorial slant&quot; of minuts. Much nonsense and commotion from dictator for life. Calvin: Nonsense?! Hobbes: 10:32: President and frist Tiger offers reasonable solution, but Dictator for life takes needless exception. Calvin: reasonalbe solution?!? You told me to go jump in a lake!

I thought I had them out right here. Dad: Your shoes? I don&#39;t know. Mom: They were right here. Where could they have gone? Dad: We&#39;re going to be late. MoM: Well I can&#39;t go anywhere without my shoes. Help me look. calvin: They&#39;re not leaving us with a babysitter tonight!

Parent: Answer the door, will you please, Calvin? Calvin: Hi Roz. My parents changed their minds about going out, so we won&#39;t be needing your services. Goodbye. Dad: Hi, Rosalyn. What are you talking about Calvin? Calvin: You can&#39;t go out if Mom can&#39;t find her shoes. Right? Dad: And what do you know about that? Calvin: Uh, nothing! Ha ha! Um, why? Are her shoes missing? Rosalyn: I&#39;d like to be paid in advance tonight.

Mom and Dad left. Now we&#39;re here alone with the baby sitter from the black lagoon. Hobbes: Hee hee! Do you think she remembers how last time we threatened to flush her science notes down the toilet? Calvin: Ha ha ha! Our finest moment! Rosalyn: Ok, you, get in bed. Calvin: What?! It&#39;s not even 6:30! Hobbes: She remembers, all right. Calvin: She can&#39;t get away with this. We&#39;ll call the rescue squad.

Rosalyn: What are you doing out of bed? Calvin: I thought I hear something outside. Rosalyn: I didn&#39;t hear anything. Calvin: It was kind of a thump. Will you go look, and make sure it&#39;s not anything scary? Rosalyn: I&#39;ll check, but I didn&#39;t hear any thump. Calvin: Yes...yes! Go out the door! Two more steps! Oh please, oh please! Yes, yes, yes! Rosalyn: See? There&#39;s nothing out here.

There&#39;s nothing out here. Calvin; But I know I herd something! Go look, ok? Please? Rosalyn: Ok, if it will make you feel...Hey! This was a trick?! Why you sneaky little drip, I&#39;ll get you!! Calvin: Hobbes! I locked her out! Calvin: Now we can watch TV and eat cookies till we&#39;re sick! Oh boy! Hobbes This is the best we&#39;ve ever been babysat!

Calvin: Don&#39;t worry, Rosalyn! There&#39;s only a 50% chance of rain tonight! Ha ha! Hobbes: She trying to open the downstairs windows. Calvin: It&#39;s ok. I already locked them. Rosalyn: You open that door! Calvin: Hey Roz! What&#39;s in your purse? Mind if we look??

Giszh! Oh, no! It&#39;s the middle of recess and there&#39;s a tyrannosaurus on the playground.  The kids at the top of the slide are the first to go! How ironic that they ahd pushed and fought each other to be there! Pandemonium ensues! Teachers line the kids up to go inside, but that proves to be sad mistake. Walking quietly in single file, the kids are gobbled up like children McNuggets! Soon the playground is empty!  It&#39;s all his! The tyrannosaur lets out a triumphant roar! Miss Wormwood: Say, where&#39;s Calvin? Recess is over. Didn&#39;t he see us line up to come in? Boy: I see him, Miss Wormwodd! He&#39;s out by the swings and he&#39;s yelling or something!

Now let me in! Calvin: Pipe down, will ya Roz? Hobbes and I can hardly hear the TV! Rosalyn: You&#39;re not supposed to be watching television! Calvin: Hey, if you go rent us a VCR and a movie, we&#39;ll put the TV near a window so you can watch too! Rosalyn: Let me in! Calvin: Are you 18? You could bet us &quot;Venusian Vampire Vixens&quot;!

Calvin: Hang on, Roz. The phone is ringing! Rosalyn: I hope it&#39;s your parents! I hope they ask to talk to me! Boy, you&#39;ll be in trouble then! Calvin: It&#39;s your boyfriend, Charlie! Should I tell him you&#39;re indisposed? Ha ha! Rosalyn: No! Let me talk to him! Calvin: Say Chas, don&#39;t you think you&#39;re settling for too little in the girlfriend department?

Dad: It&#39;s so nice and quiet. We should do this more often. Rosalyn: Calvin, you&#39;ve got five seconds to open the door before I break a window! Calvin: I&#39;m telling you Chuck, your girlfriend is psycho! I hope you&#39;re not making any long-range plans around her.

All the TV show&#39;s we&#39;re not allowed to watch, and a bag of cookies each! Hey, what was that? Aaugh! Rosalyn! H-how did you g-get in??*gulp* Whoops, I think it&#39;s past my bedtime.

An innocent mistake! Let me explain! Mom: Calvin, listen closely. Locking Rosalyn out of the house wasn&#39;t just mean, it was dangerous. If you&#39;d hurt yourself or if there was a fire, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to help you. You go aplolgize to Rosalyn right now. Clavin: I-I&#39;m sorry, Rosalyn. Dad: And we&#39;re sorry too. I promise you Calvin will behave himself next time. Rosalyn: An extra five would help there be a next times.

Stealing Mom&#39;s shoes and making Mom and Dad late...Then locking the babysitter out of the house...whoof. That&#39;s a lot to live down for just one evening. I feel pretty bad. Hobbes: And having eaten a whole package of Oreo&#39;s doesn&#39;t help. Calvin: You said it.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1989|10|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/10/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/47f365b0decc013171a6005056a9545d|634|900|Calvin: That big dumb bully Moe punched me at school yesterday. Hobbes: Really? What did you do? Calvin: Well, first I skidded across the playground. Then I caromed off a rock and...I wish I had more friends, but people are such jerks. If you can just get most people to ignore you and leave you alone, you&#39;re doing good. If you can find even one person you really like, you&#39;re lucky. And if that person can also stand you, you&#39;re really lucky. Hobbes: What if you find someone you can talk to while you eat apples on a bright fall morning? Calvin: Well, yeah...I suppose there&#39;s no point in getting greedy, is there?

How am I ever going to read three whole pages of this by tomorrow? It&#39;s impossible! ...Impossible?? Why, nothing&#39;s impossible! Not for...Stupendous Man! Bum ba ba daa dum bum ba ba daa dum...
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1989|10|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/10/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4a691d80decb013171a6005056a9545d|303|900|Calvin: Yes! It&#39;s ...Stupendous Man! Friend of freedom! Opponenet of oppression! Lover of liberty! Great moons of Jupiter! Calvin (Stupendous Man&#39;s 6-year-old alter ego) has three pages of boring homework to read! It&#39;s tyranny! Although Stupendous Man vould easily read the assignment with high-speed vision, the masked man of might has a bolder plan! With stupendous powers of reasoning, the caped combatant comcludes there&#39;s no need for homework if there&#39;s no school tomorrow!

It&#39;s Stupendous Man! Seconds later, the amazing marvel alights upon an observatory telescope at Mount Palomar. With stupendous strength, Stupendous Man carefully unscrews the giant lens... ...and blasts into space with it!

Aligned perfectly with the sun, the magnifying lens focuses the terrible solar energy... ...and fries a certain elementary school clean off the map! Now mile-mannered Calvin has no need to do his homework ever again! Liberty prevails! Parent: How&#39;s your homework coming, Calvin?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1989|10|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/10/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4e8a8f30decb013171a6005056a9545d|298|900|Calvin: Uh oh, it&#39;s my arch-nemesis, Mom-lady! She can&#39;t discover my secret identity! Mom: Calvin? Are you doing your homework in there? Calvin: Quickly Stupendous Man leaps into the closet to change back into his  6-year-old alter ego, mild-mannered Calvin! Mom: Calvin? Are you in here? Calvin: Unfortunately Stupendous Man&#39;s cape is caught in mild-mannered Calvin&#39;s zipper! Curses! Mom: This is going to be a good one, I can tell. Calvin: Geez, Mom! Can&#39;t a guy have a little privacy?!

Calvin: Oh, no reason. Um...I was hot. Mom: You&#39;re supposed to be doing your homework! Calvin: I don&#39;t need to do it now, thanks to Stupendous Man! Mom: Oh yeah? Calvin: It was great! He fried the school with a big magnifying lens in space! I&#39;m sure it will be in all the papers tomorrow. Boy, she&#39;ll be in trouble when she gives me my costume back. Big trouble.

Susie: Hi, Calvin. Whatcha doin&#39;? Calvin: Oof, get this big lummox off me.  Susie: Look at you! You didn&#39;t even change you of your school clothes! Calvin: How could I?!  I didn&#39;t even get in the door! Every day this maniac is so glad to see me that he blasts out like a big orange torpedo! A dog will just wag its tail, but of course a tiger has to pounce on you! Stupid animal! Susie: He pounces on you? Calvin: Oh, and don&#39;t think he doesn&#39;t enjoy the cunning and treachery of it all!  Tigers live for the thrill of a sneak attack!  It&#39;s their evil nature! Susie: He&#39;s just sitting there.  Calvin: Oh, sure, big disguise! Like no one can fathom the savage mind of a jungle cat! Ha! He&#39;s a killer to the core! Susie: I wish my parents would move. My diary is getting weirder every day. Calvin: Yeah, you know who I&#39;m talking about! Wipe off that grin or I&#39;ll do it for you!

As an ectotherm, his body relies on the environment to warm or cool it&#39;s temperature. Now that it&#39;s colder outside, Calvin&#39;s body temperature falls and he becomes sluggish! He&#39;ll go into torpor if he can&#39;t find a warm place to lie! Mom: Leave the thermostat alone, and put on a sweater if you&#39;re cold. Calvin: I...I don&#39;t have the en..energy!

Hobbes: That&#39;s true. We&#39;re too fierce and ferocious we don&#39;t ever purr. Calvin: Well what do you call the noise you make when you get your tummy rubbed?! Hobbes: Growling friendly-like.

Calvin: But I don&#39;t like school. Dad: Why not? You like to read and you like to learn. I know you do. I mean, you&#39;ve read every dinosaur book ever written, and you&#39;ve learned a lot, right? Reading and learning are fun. Calvin: Yeah. Dad: So why don&#39;t you like school? Calvin: We don&#39;t read about dionsaurs.

Maybe I&#39;d get better grades if you offered me $1 for every &quot;D,&quot; $5 for every &quot;C,&quot; $10 for every &quot;B,&quot; and $50 for every &quot;A&quot;! Dad: I&#39;m not going to bribe you, Calvin. You should apply yourself for your own good. Calvin: Rats. I thought I could make an easy four bucks.

Valley Hardware? Yes, I&#39;m calling to see if you sell blasting caps, detonators, timers and wire. Just the wire? Oh, forget it. Do you rent bulldozers or backhoes? No, no, a rototiller won&#39;t do at all. I need something more like a wrecking ball. Do you know where I could get anything like that? No? Ok, goodbye. Looks like another boring day, Hobbes.

I&#39;ve been thinking. Hobbes: What about? Calvin: Well, suppose there&#39;s no afterlife. That would mean this life is all you get. And that would mean I&#39;m sitting here in bed as precious moments of my all-too-short life disappear forever. Mom: Honey, wake up. Di you hear the television on?

Someone must&#39;ve waylaid Mr. Sandman. I just can&#39;t get comfortable. Mmf. I&#39;m exhausted, but I can&#39;t fall asleep. Maybe if I just lie still and think about how good it feels to be in bed, and how soft the pillow is, and how very, very tired I am...Phooey, this isn&#39;t working.  All I want is to get some sleep. This is awful. Mom: Calvin? Calvin: Gee Mom, are you awake too? Mom: It&#39;s time to get up.  Calvin: It can&#39;t be! It&#39;s the middle of the night and I haven&#39;t slept a wink yet! Mom: Calvin? C&#39;mon, up and at em. Calvin: This is going to be a bad day.

Mom: Oh? What? Calvin: I was minding my own business, when suddenly I was zapped into some sort of space vortex! There I watched helplessly as an evil duplicate of myself from a parallel universe took my place on earth, and... Mom: What have you done now? Calvin: No, no, see, it wasn&#39;t me...

Calvin: Aha! I see you! Sneaking up to pounce on me, eh? Hobbes: Phooey. Calvin: YOu see why most tigers don&#39;t chuckle to themselves.

Hobbes: Ok. Calvn: It&#39;s called &quot;gross out.&quot; You say the grossest thing you can imagine and then I try to think of something even grosser. Whoever comes up with the grossest thing gets a point, and we play until someone gets 50 points, Ok? Hobbes: I think I already know who&#39;s going to win. Calvin: It&#39;s weird. Nobody had ever played a whole game with me.

Hobbes: What&#39;s your topic? Calvin: Bats. Can you imagine anything more stupid? Heck, I don&#39;t know anything about bats! How am I supposed to write a report on a subject I know nothing about?! It&#39;s impossible! Hobbes: I suppose research is out of the question. Calvin: Oh, like I&#39;m going to learn about bats and then write a report?! Give me a break!

This is Calvin. You know this report we&#39;re supposed to write for school? Yeah. My topic is bats. What&#39;s yours? Elephants? Hmm. Well, are you going to the library to look up elephants? You are? Great! While you&#39;re there, could you research bats too, and make copies of all the information you find, and maybe underline the important parts for me, and sort of outline it so I wouldn&#39;t have to read it all? Hobbes: How&#39;d it go? Calvin: I really loathe girls.

Mom: I&#39;ll count to 10 and then...pow! Calvin: Dad, how come old photographs are always black and white? Didn&#39;t they have color film back then? Dad: Sure they did. In fact, those old photographs are in color. It&#39;s just the world was black and white then. Calvin: Really? Dad: Yep. The world didn&#39;t turn color until sometime in the 1930&#39;s and it was pretty grainy color for a while, too. Calvin: That&#39;s really weird. Dad: Well, truth is stranger than fiction. Calvin: But then why are old paintings in color?! If the world was black and white, wouldn&#39;t artists have painted it that way? Dad: Not necessarily. A lot of great artists were insane. Calvin: But how could they have painted in color anyway? Wouldn&#39;t thair paints have been shades of gray back then? Dad: Of course, but they turned colors life everything else did in the 30&#39;s. Calvin: So why didn&#39;t old black and white photos turn color too? Dad: because they were color pictures of black and white, remember? Calvin: The world is a complicated place, Hobbes. HObbes: Whenever it seems that way, I take a nap in a tree and wait for dinner.

You&#39;ve got to help me, Hobbes! Hobbes: Ok, ...um, first let&#39;s make a list of what we know. Calvin: Yeah! That&#39;s a good way to start! Great! Hobbes: Number one: What are bats? Calvin: They&#39;re bugs, aren&#39;t they? Yeah, put that down. Hobbes: Are you sure? Calvin: They fly, right? They&#39;re ugly and hairy, right? C&#39;mon, this is taking all day!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1989|10|31|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/10/31|https://assets.amuniversal.com/63b94270decb013171a6005056a9545d|298|900|Calvin: I think we&#39;ve got enough information now, don&#39;t you? Hobbes: All we have is one &quot;fact&quot; you made up. Calvin: That&#39;s plenty. By the time we add an introduction, a few illustrations, and a conclusion, it will look like a graduate thesis. Cesides, I&#39;be got a secret weapon that will guarantee me a good grade! No teacher can resist this! Hobbes: What is it? Calvin: A clear plastic binder! Pretty professional looking, eh? Hobbes: I don&#39;t want co-author credit on this, Ok?

Did you write your report? Susie: Yeah, I spent all last evening on it. Did you? Calvin: Well, when you know as much as I do, it doesn&#39;t take as long. Mine took about 15 minutes. Susie: 15 minutes?! Let&#39;s see. Calvin: I guess you won&#39;t be setting the grade curve this time, Susie! Read it and weep. Susie: &quot;Bats: The big bug scourge of the skies.&quot; Calvin: Note the professional clear plastic binder. Susie: Bats aren&#39;t bugs!

Calvin: I would! I would! Miss Wormwood: Why Calvin, what a surprise to see you volunteer! You must have done a good job. Go to the front of the class. Calvin: Oh boy! Miss Wormwood: Now let&#39;s all pay attention. Go ahead, Calvin. Clavin: Thank you. Before I begin, I&#39;d like everyone to notive that my report is in a professional, clear, plastic binder. Miss Wormwood: That&#39;s very nice. Go ahead. Calvin: When a report looks this good, you know it&#39;ll get an &quot;A.&quot; That&#39;s a good tip, kids, write it down.

Miss Wormwood: Calvin, I&#39;d like to see you a moment.

Can you believe what my teacher wrote on my report? She says I obviously did no research whatsoever on bats and that my scientific illustration looks like I traced the batman logo and added fangs! Hobbes: She&#39;s pretty perceptive. Calvin: She didn&#39;t even give me credit for my professional clear plastic binder! Hobbes: What did your parents have to say? Calvin: Nothing. And if you&#39;ll give me a hand here, it will stay that way.

Hobbes: On a weekend?  Calvin: Well, it wasn&#39;t on purpose...I believe history is a force.  Its unalterable tide seeps all people and institutions along its unrelenting path.  Everything and everyone serves history&#39;s single purpose.  Hobbes: And what is that purpose? Calvin: Why, to produce me, of course! I&#39;m the end result of history.

What did you bring for lunch today? Susie: A swiss cheese and ketchip sandwich. It&#39;s my very favorite, too, so I dont&#39; want to hear what gross thing you brought. Calvin: Relax, Susie. I bought the cafeteria lunch today. Susie: Good. Calvin: IT appears to be cigar butts in a gallstone sauce. Susie: That&#39;s beany-wienies! Calvin: Really? Oh gross.

Calvin: Hi, Dad. It&#39;s me, Calvin. Dad: You&#39;re supposed to be at school! Calvin: I am at school. Dad: Are you all right? What&#39;s the matter? Why are you calling? Calvin: I told the teacher I had to go to the bathroom. Quick, what&#39;s 11 + 7?

Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.

Hobbes: What&#39;s with the sled? There&#39;s no snow. Calvin: I aim to fix that right now with an appeal to the snow demons. Hobbes: Snow demons? Calvin: Obviously they&#39;re tormenting us with this wimpy weather because they&#39;re angry. We must appease them. Hobbes: Oh. Calvin: I&#39;m going to lie here on my sled and think snow thoughts until the snow demons have mercy and unleash a blizzard. Snow, snow! High and low! Wherever we go! Let it blow! To and fro! Hi-De-Ho! Snow! Snow! Snow! Hobbes: Well, I&#39;ll come out in early January and see how you&#39;re doing. Calvin: Tell Mom I&#39;ll need my meals out here and I won&#39;t be going to school tomorrow.

What am I doing on teh ceiling? Hmm...nothing else fell up. Just me. This is very strange. Even if I try to jump to the floor, I land back on the ceiling! My personal gravity must have recersed polarity! You&#39;d think this would be the type of thing we&#39;d learn about in science class, but no, we learn about cirrus clouds.

How an I going to get up to the floor? There&#39;s not anytnig on the ceiling that I could even climb up. How am I supposed to do my homework when I&#39;m trapped on the ceiling? It&#39;s impossible.

No sir. Dad will have to bolt my bed to the ceiling tonight, and mom will have to stand on a step ladder to hand me dinner. Then I&#39;ll have to hold my plate upside down above my head and scrape the food off the underside! And if I spill anything, it will fly 10 feet up to the floor and splot! This is going to be the most fun I&#39;ve ever had!

I wish I could get my roller skates. Hey, maybe I can climb up this bookcase and when I get to the bottom shelf, leap to a chair! Then I can pull myself across to other pieces of furniture and work my way to the toy chest. ...I can her mom now: &quot;How on earth did you get sneaker prints on the underside of each shelf?!&quot;

I fall up now! I&#39;ve been trapped on the ceiling! I couldn&#39;t do homework up there! My desk is on the floor! You should be glad I wasn&#39;t outside when it happened, or I&#39;d be sailing throught the ionosphere! Mom: Right. Now I don&#39;t want to hear any more nonsense until you&#39;re through with your homework, understand? Calvin: Don&#39;t let go! Don&#39;t let go!

My personal gravity is back to normal! Mom: Glad to her it. Now do your math. Calvin: You bet, Mom. Boy, what a relief to be pulled down instead of up! Mom: I&#39;ll check your progress in a little bit. Calvin: Uh oh.

The muck monsters veer off, afraid to follow the fearless Spiff into the frozen fragments of ice and rock!

Another &quot;Discussion&quot; about my study habits and the importance of homework. I tried explaining that it&#39;s hard to study when one&#39;s size suddenly starts increasing, but does she care?! Hah! No, it&#39;s just blah blah blah like it&#39;s all my fault! Mom&#39;s never been as big as a galaxy, so she can&#39;t understand how anyone else could be! Sheesh. Oops, it looks like she&#39;s wrapping up. Better start nodding. Mom: Good, I&#39;m glad we had this little talk.

Calvin: Yeahhhh....boy, you missed the show. I got a big lecture from Mom just because I got stuck on the ceiling and the grew so big I fell off the planet when I was supposed to be doing my math! Hobbes: Gee, that&#39;s not very fair. Calvin: You said it. Here, how about helping me with these problems? Hobbes: Sure! Tigers are great at math! Now what do these little horizontal lines mean? Calvin: That&#39;s a minus sign. Let me know when you&#39;re done, Ok? I&#39;ll be reading comic books.

Well, enough chit chat. Let&#39;s get down to business.  This year I want..)  Calvin: Will you drive to work and fax my Christmas list to Santa? Hobbes: That&#39;s a big envelope. Are you mailing a book? Calvin: This is my Christmas list. Can you believe this is costing me $2.40 to send? Hobbes: Yes. Calvin: Well, at this price all I can say is that Santa had better read it darn carefully. Last year I didn&#39;t get half of what wanted. Hobbes: Have you behaved any better this year? Calvin: It depends on how you...Hey, just what are you insinuating?! Why, I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve been a veritable angel this year, just like always! Hobbes: In that case, we can have a cookout with your stocking contents. Calvin: Don&#39;t get smart, Bub, or I&#39;ll wallop you on the 26th. Hobbes: Did you put anything on your list for me? Calvin: What, and pay more postage? This package is breaking my arms already! Go write your own list! Hobbes: Tidings of comfort and joy to you too. Calvin: Look, it&#39;s every man for himself in this world. Now give me a boost, will ya?

Dad: Oh, I dunno. Probably a little after New Year&#39;s. Calvin: After New Year?? Dad: Sure. We can just go up the street and pick from the neighbors&#39; driveways. Calvin: What?! Dad: Sometimes there&#39;s still tinsel on the tree too, so you don&#39;t even have to decorate it! We&#39;ll save time and money! Mom: Ok. What did your dad tell you this time?

Yeah, little dust balls!

What&#39;s this disgusting stuff. Mom: It&#39;s spider pie. You can pick out the big legs and give them to your dad if they&#39;re too hairy for you. Clavin: S-s-spider p-pie?

Clavin: No, it&#39;s too much trouble. First I&#39;d have to get up. Thenn I&#39;d have to put on a coat. Then I&#39;d have to find my hat and put it on. (sigh) Then we&#39;d run around and I&#39;d get tired, and when we came in I&#39;d have to take all that stuff off. No way. Hobbes: So what are you going to do instead? Calvin: I&#39;m just going to sit here and wait for a good TV show to come on. Hobbes: I&#39;ll tell your Mom to turn you toward the light and water you periodically. Calvin: Instead of making smart remarks, you could get me the remote control.

Calvin: It&#39;s a polar bear blinking in a blizzard!  Ha ha ha ha!  Hobbes: Know what this is? Calvin: In snowed! Oh my gosh, look at it all! A creeping mountain of ice has crushed half the neighborhood! It&#39;s a glacier! Right in my own town! Everything north of here has been wiped off the face of the earth! This is great! Wow! Wooly mammoths! I&#39;ve never seen those before! It&#39;s a new ice age! Hoorayy!!  Sled city! One...lousy...half..inch! Hobbes: Look, the sun is coming out!

I&#39;ve called you three times! You&#39;re going to miss the bus! Calvin: That&#39;s the idea. I&#39;m staying in bed until Christmas. I want tons of loot this year, and I figure my chances of being good improve gratly if I don&#39;t get up. Mom: Disobeying your mother and missing the bus isn&#39;t good. It&#39;s bad. Calvin: That darn Santa has got me every way I turn.

It&#39;s just that, well, sometimes events beyond my control conspire against me! I&#39;m usually an innocent bystand...hey, I say you roll your eyes! So you don&#39;t believe me, eh?! Hobbes: Me?? Calvin: By golly, each of your eyes will be rolling toward the other when I&#39;m through with you! Hobbes: Ha! I hope you asked Santa for some crutches!

Question my integrity will you? Hobbes: I can&#39;t question it until I see some evidence of it! Clavin; Aaughh! I&#39;ve been fighting! Hobbes: Only in the loosest sense of the word.

This can be our little secret, ok? Santa doesn&#39;t have to know about this, right? Hobbes: Maybe he does and maybe he doesn&#39;t. Calvin: Ok, ok, I&#39;ll even apologize! I&#39;m sorry. How&#39;s that? See, it&#39;s ok to fight just a little bit if you say you&#39;re sorry afterward. Hobbes: You bit and kicked. Calvin: I said I was sorry! What more do you want?! Hobbes: You could let me read all your comic books. Calvin: Over my dead body! Hobbes: &quot;Dear Santa, know what Calvin did today?&quot;

Hobbes: Yeah, I&#39;d like to see you try! Calvin: Oh no you don&#39;t! You&#39;re not tempting me! I want every item on my Christmas list, so I&#39;m being good. No matter what the provocation! Hobbes: Here comes Susie Derkins. Calvin: Really? Quick, help me find a pine come I can throw at... ...No! I&#39;m being good! Good! Good! Good! Good! Hobbes: You&#39;ll never make it till Christmas.

Are you bringing your stuffed tiger to school today? Calvin: No, he&#39;s just keeping me company while I wait for the bus. Susie: Oh. Calvin: But actually, he&#39;s been nothing but trouble today. He&#39;s trying to make me sabotage my Christmas by making me be bad instead of good. Fortunately, I asked Santa for such great presents that I can withstand any temptation. I&#39;m being an absolute angel. Susie: What did you ask for? Calvin: A heat-seeking guided missle. I figure five minutes with one of those babies will make up for this whole rotten month.

Calvin: &quot;Dear Calvin, you rotten little kid..Oh No!! Santa called me rotten! I&#39;m doomed! Hobbes: Keep reading. Calvin: &quot;I made a list, but I didn&#39;t bother checking it twice, because obviously you&#39;re the naughtiest kid in the whole world.&quot; Augh! Hobbes: What else? Calvin: &quot;I&#39;m writing to give you one last chance. You&#39;ve got seven days to get on the &quot;good boy&quot; list.&quot;  Seven days!! Oh no! What can I do??  Hobbes: Maybe he says. Calvin: &quot;I&#39;d suggest you start by being kind to animals. Perhaps you know an animal who would like a snack soon. Or maybe you sholud let an animal read your comic books sometimes. Think about it.&quot; Hobbes: Sounds like sage advice. Calvin: &quot;Signed, Santa Claws.&quot; Santa Claws? Wait a minute! I recognize this handwriting! It&#39;s yours! Santa didn&#39;t write this at all!!  Give you a snack, huh! How about a knuckle sandwich?!  Hobbes: Hmph, well, it&#39;s what Santa would&#39;ve written if he wasn&#39;t so busy now.

Hobbes: Sure. What&#39;s it about? Calvin: Well, you know what historical fiction is? This is sort of like that. I&#39;m writing a fictional autobiography. It&#39;s the story of my life, but with a lot of parts complately made up. Hobbes: Why would you make up your own life? Calvin: Because in my book, I have a flame thrower!

Either you can give me 15 bucks to pay my labor and production costs... Dad: 15 bucks?! Calvin: ...Or you can be the subject of a comic strip called &quot;Dopey Dad.&quot; Clavn: So in the next panel, Dopey Dad yells, &quot;It&#39;s bedtime for you, young man!&quot; Hobbes: Hee hee!

Christmas songs, familiar, slow, play softly on the radio. Pops and hisses from the fire whistle with the bells and choir. My tiger is now fast asleep on his back and dreaming deep. When the fire makes him hot, he turns to warm whatever&#39;s not. Propped against him on the rug, I give my friend agentle hug. Tomorrow&#39;s what I&#39;m waiting for, but I can wait a little more.

For your information, I&#39;m staying like this, and everyone else can just get used to it! If people don&#39;t like me the way I am, well, tough beans! It&#39;s a free country! I don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s permission to be the way I want! This is how I am - take it or leave it! By golly, life&#39;s too darn short to waste time trying to please every meddlesome moron who&#39;s got an idea how I ought to be! I don&#39;t need advice! Everyone can just stay out of my face!  I...Hobbes? Hmph! He should resolve to be more attentive when someone is speaking.

Mom?  ...Mom??  Hey Mom!  Hobbes:  &quot;Calvin, I&#39;m next door.  Don&#39;t have anything to eat or you&#39;ll spoil your appetite.  Mom.&quot;  Calvin:  It&#39;s going to be a long, cold, dark winter.

I&#39;m a genius, Hobbes. There&#39;s simply no other word for it. Who else would think to arm a toboggan! It&#39;s just genius! See Susie Derkins down there? She&#39;s building a snow man and doesn&#39;t even know we&#39;re up here! We&#39;ll zip down and pelt her silly with snowballs! You steer and I&#39;ll throw! See, the snowballs will gain even more force from our own velocity! Genis, huh! Ha ha! We&#39;ll be a mile away before she can even pick her head out of the snow! There she is! Steer closer so I can get her! Lean! Lean! Augh! Steer! You&#39;re too close!  Mayday!!  Another genius thwarted by an incapable assistant. Susie: Hey Calvin, look up.

My newest invention!  Hobbes:  Isn&#39;t that your transmogrifier?  Calvin:  It was, but I made some modifications.  See, the box is on its side now.  It&#39;s a duplicator!  Hobbes:  Ah.  Calvin:  It combines the technologies of the transmogrifier and a photocopier, so instead of merely making a reproduction on paper, this machine actually creates a real duplicate!  Hobbes:  So our financial worries are over?  Calvin:  And counterfeiting is just one of its many uses around the home!

Calvin:  I was just about to.  You can help.  Hobbes:  Oh boy!  What will we duplicate first?  Calvin:  Me!  Hobbes:  You??  Calvin:  Yeah!  Mom wants me to clean my room, so I&#39;ll duplicate myself and let the duplicate do the work!  Smart, huh?  Hobbes:  I can picture the look on your parents&#39; faces when they find out they&#39;ve suddenly had twins.  Calvin:  Twins, heck!  This summer I can make a whole baseball team!

Hobbes:  Are you sure this is such a good idea?  Calvin:  Brother!  You doubting Thomases get in the way of more scientific advances with your stupid ethical questions!  This is a brilliant idea!  Hit the button, will ya?  Hobbes:  I&#39;d hate to be accused of inhibiting scientific progress...here you go.  Scientific progress goes &quot;boink&quot;?  Calvin:  It worked!  It worked!  I&#39;m a genius!  No you&#39;re not, you liar!  I invented this!

Hobbes meet my duplicate!  Hey, nice room.  Hobbes:  Oog, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready for this.  Calvin:  Ok, dupe!  Hobbes and I are going out to play.  You clean my room, and when you&#39;re done, I&#39;ve got some homework you can do, too.  What?!  Forget it, bub!  Find some other sucker to do your dirty work!  Last one outside is a rotten egg!  Hey!  Come back here!  Hobbes:  He&#39;s a duplicate of you, all right.  Calvin:  What do you mean?  This guy is a total jerk!

Did you clean your room like I asked you to?  Calvin:  I&#39;m going outside.  Calvin can clean his own room.  Mom:  I don&#39;t want any nonsense, Calvin.  Go upstairs.  Calvin:  Calvin?  I&#39;m not Calvin.  I&#39;m his duplicate.  Calvin&#39;s in his room.  Mom:  What did I just say?  No nonsense, Calvin!  Go clean your room.  Calvin:  Boy, your are a crabby lady!  Who are you?  Calvin&#39;s cruel governess?  Mom:  That does it.

We&#39;d better go find my duplicate before he gets me in trouble.  I&#39;m telling you, lady, you&#39;ve got the wrong guy!  I&#39;m a duplicate of Calvin!  Calvin&#39;s in his room!  Mom:  We&#39;ll see about that.  Give me your coat.  See, Calvin?  There&#39;s no one here.  Now that&#39;s enough games.  Clean your room, ok?  Calvin:  Calvin?  I don&#39;t see him, Hobbes.  Maybe he&#39;s outside, huh?  Hobbes:  We&#39;d better hurry.  I think I hear your mom coming down the stairs.

What are you doing outside?  Didn&#39;t I just send you to clean your room two minutes ago?!  Calvin:  No.  Mom:  I did too!  Now get back upstairs.  I&#39;m losing my patience for this game!  Calvin:  She must&#39;ve found my duplicate!  C&#39;mon Hobbes, we&#39;d better hurry before he gets us in more trouble!  Number three, hi!  I&#39;m number two!  Charmed.

We&#39;d better straighten him...  Calvin/Hobbes:  AAUGH!  Hobbes:  Your duplicator is a big success.  Calvin:  Oh no!  Calvin 2:  Are you kidding?  It burned out after the fifth one of us!

So long as we split up and she only sees one of us at a time, she&#39;ll just think we&#39;re you!  What a bunch of devious little stinkers!  Where&#39;d they learn to misbehave like that?!

When are we going home? Mom: This is just a little walk, Calvin. The exercise is good for you. Calvin: But I&#39;m freezing! It must be 80 below! My toes are numb! Dad: Numb toes build character. Calvin: Yeah? What about frostbite?! What about hypothermia?! What about death?! I suppose those build character too! I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m out here! This is the worst day of my entire life! I hate this! Aren&#39;t we going home yet? It seems like we&#39;ve been walking for hours! Mom: Calvin, will you please stop griping? Calvin: Griping? I&#39;m not griping! I&#39;m just observing what a miserable experiece this is! But ok! Sure! As long as I&#39;m trudging hundreds of miles for no apparant reason, I might as well do it in silence, right?!

As long as you&#39;re all here and I don&#39;t know how to get rid of you, we might as well cooperate.  Specifically, with five duplicates, we can divide up the school week so there&#39;s one duplicate for each day.  If the rest of us lay low, we can take turns going to school, and no one will be the wiser!  Great!  Now that still leaves us with the question of who gets the bed tonight.  Calvin:  We&#39;ll fight you for it.

We&#39;re all taking turns so we each only go once a week.  Susie Derkins:  Calvin, you are so weird I&#39;m not even going to talk to you.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not Calvin.

Duplicate two was here yesterday, not me.  We&#39;re all taking turns.  Number two will be back next week, and you can ask him to do the problem then.

Geez, you guys!  Even I don&#39;t get sent to the principal every day!  You&#39;re making me look bad!  Look, Calvin, if you don&#39;t like our performance, you can go to school yourself!  Whoa, let&#39;s not jump to conclusions!  I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s room for improvement.  Hey four, were you able to swipe any chalk?  Yeah!  The principal never frisked me!

Calvin:  Throw what?  Susie Derkins:  Let me see your mittens!  There, look!  Flecks of bark, pieces of gravel, spots of mud, and granules of ice!  That was your snowball, all right!  Calvin:  That&#39;s the problem with having a signature style.

You missed by a mile!  Nyah nyahh!  Thbptbh!  Yes?  Calvin:  You&#39;re darn lucky I didn&#39;t get that snow-blower for Christmas!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|2|4|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/04|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7305f040df740131723d005056a9545d|632|900|Calvin: Let&#39;s hurry down this hill and go home. Hobbes: What&#39;s the rush? Calvin: There&#39;s a TV show on sledding I want to watch. In my opinion television validates existence. Take this sled ride, for instance. The experience is fleeting and elusive. By tomorrow, we&#39;ll have forgotten it, and it may as well have not even happened. But if we were on TV now, countless viewers would share in the event and confirm it! This ride would become a part of mass consciousness! And, on TV, the impact of an event is determined by the image, not its substance.

Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|2|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/52046b00dece013171ac005056a9545d|297|900|Calvin:  I&#39;d planned to take the day off and spend time with a couple of buddies.  My buddies travel light and they&#39;re fun to have around.  One travels in a holster, and the other in a hip flask.  My name is Bullet.  Tracer Bullet.  What people call me is something else again.  I&#39;m a private eye.  It says so on my door.  The last thing I wanted this morning was a case to solve, but the dame who brought it was persuasive.  Most dames are, somehow.  Miss Wormwood:  Get to work, Calvin.  Calvin:  I told her it would cost her fifty greenbacks a day, plus expenses.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|2|7|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/07|https://assets.amuniversal.com/538c3bc0dece013171ac005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  I stepped out into the rainy streets and reviewed the facts.  There weren&#39;t many.  Two saps, Jack and Joe, drive toward each other at 60 and 30 mph.  After 10 minutes, they pass.  I&#39;m supposed to find out how far apart they started.  Questions pour down like the rain.  Who are these mugs?  What were they trying to accomplish?  Why was Jack in such a hurry?  And what difference does it make where they started from??  I had a hunch that, before this was over, I&#39;d be sorry I asked.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|2|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5512f460dece013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  First I figured I&#39;d try the Derkins dame.  Susie and I never hit it off, although occasionally we hit each other.  Susie had a face that suggested somebody upstairs had a weird sense of humor, but I wasn&#39;t going to her place for laughs.  I needed information.  The way I looked at it, Derkins acted awfully smug for a dame who had a head for numbers and not much else.  Maybe she&#39;s got something on Jack and Joe.  The question is, will she sing?  Susie Derkins:  No, I won&#39;t tell you what the answer is!  Do your own work!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|2|9|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/09|https://assets.amuniversal.com/568a0fa0dece013171ac005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  The Derkins dame wasn&#39;t talking.  Someone had gotten to her first and shut her up good.  I knew Susie, and closing her mouth would&#39;ve taken some work.  I needed a clue and a drink.  One of them I knew where to find.  Miss Wormwood:  You&#39;ve made enough trips to the water fountain.  Finish your quiz.  Calvin:  Suddenly a gorilla pulled me in an alley, squeezed my spine into an accordion, and played a polka on me with brass knuckles!  Man:  Youse ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere, flatfoot.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|2|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/02/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/58132620dece013171ac005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  The inside of my head was exploding with fireworks.  Fortunately, my last thought turned out the lights when it left.  When I came to, the pieces all fit together.  Jack and Joe&#39;s lives were defined by integers.  Obviously, they were part of a &quot;numbers&quot; racket!  Back in the office, I pulled the files on all the numbers big enough to keep Susie quiet and want me out of the picture.  The answer hit me like a .44 slug.  It had to be the number they called &quot;Mr. Billion.&quot;  Calvin:  Case closed!  Miss Wormwood:  Time&#39;s up.  Bring your papers forward.  Susie Derkins:  What did you get, Calvin?  I think the answer&#39;s 15.

It helps me avoid Calvin. Winter has wrapped the land in a soft, white blanket, and the earth sleeps quietly. Calvin, out of frame: Whoaa. Oomph. AA! Look out below! Lean! Lean! Augh! Mayday! Bail out! SMASH! Calvin: You call that steering? We almost got killed! My fault? Yeah, step over here and say that you stripey dope! That&#39;s right, I&#39;m talking to you! Hey! Ow! Quit biting!! Oof! Take that! Ow! Susie: I think when I grow up, I&#39;ll live in the tropics. Calvin: Quit it! Quit it! Let go! Hobbes: Whee! Let&#39;s get the sled out of the tree and do that again! Calvin: You know what we need for our sled? A siren!

Mom:  Oh no.  Calvin:  Hurry!  If we jump in the car, you can zoom up, pass the bus on a straightaway, drop me off at a later stop, and I can ride the bus from there!  C&#39;mon!  What are you waiting for?  Rev up the car!  Mom&#39;s so lazy.

Calvin:  Aw, Mom!  Can&#39;t I watch the next program?  Mom:  No, you need your sleep.  C&#39;mon.  Calvin:  Can I just watch another 15 minutes?  Please??  Ok, just 10 minutes!  Then I&#39;ll go straight to bed!  Five minutes!  Just five minutes, ok?  Mom:  Turn off the TV.  Calvin:  Look I&#39;ll just watch a few more commercials, ok?  See, here&#39;s my favorite gum commercial!  I guess that got pretty pathetic.

I just remembered that today is &quot;Show and Tell&quot; day!  I need something to show and tell about!  Mom:  Why can&#39;t you think of these things more than two minutes before the bus comes?  Calvin:  What can I take?  I&#39;ve gotta take something!  I&#39;ve..ah...never mind, Mom!  Do we have any plastic bags?  Mom:  I don&#39;t want to know.  I don&#39;t want to know.  I don&#39;t...

See?  Starboard is right!  Port is left!  Calvin:  OK, so I was wrong for once in my life!  Shut up.

I missed!  It&#39;s these darn fuzzy mittens!  The snow sticks to &#39;em and you can&#39;t throw straight!  Darn it!  Darn it!  I hate these fuzzy mittens!  If only Mom had gotten me padded gloves instead of these no-good, awful, rotten fuzzy mittens!  Hobbes:  Well I&#39;ll be!  My fuzzy mittens have pads!

Another day, another mind-boggling adventure! The fearless Spaceman Spiff cruises low over planet Quorg, a desolate world of deep gorges and canyons! Searching for life, our hero explores the peculiar rock formations! ...The very peculiar rock formations! ...A little too peculiar, perhaps! Suddenly our hero realizes that this landscape was not created by geological forces! Spiff hits the thrusters! While Spiff was searching for alien life, it seems alien life was searching for Spiff! No doubt it wanted the earthling for dinner! Voice from out of frame: Calvin, where are you?! It&#39;s time for dnner! Ugh! Spiff blasts into hyperspace!

This snow sculpture transcends corporeal likeness to express deeper truths about the human condition!  This sculpture is about grief and suffering!  One look at the tortured countenance that the artist has drunk deeply from the cup of life!  This work shall endure and inspire future generations!

Calvin:  Yep!  Hobbes:  Yesterday your sculpture melted.  Calvin:  This time I&#39;m taking advantage of my medium&#39;s impermanence.  This sculpture is about transience.  As this figure melts, it invites the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life.  This piece speaks to the horror of our own morality!  Child:  Hey stupid!  It&#39;s too warm to build a snowman!  What a dope!  Ha ha ha ha!  Hobbes:  A Philistine on the sidewalk.  Calvin:  Genius is never understood in its own time.

Calvin:  I&#39;ve moved into abstraction!  Hobbes:  Ah.  Calvin:  This piece is about the inadequacy of traditional imagery and symbols to convey meaning in today&#39;s world.  By abondoning representationalism, I&#39;m free to express myself with pure form.  Specific interpretation gives way to a more visceral response.  Hobbes:  I notice your oeuvre is monochromatic.  Calvin:  Well, c&#39;mon it&#39;s just snow.

Dad:  Well, I suppose that would be provoking.  So yes, it would be a little bad.  Calvin:  As bad ast if you&#39;d hit the person?  Dad:  No, not that bad, but worse than if you hadn&#39;t thrown it at all.  Calvin:  Suppose you just grazed the person.  How bad would that be?  Say maybe you knocked off his hat and his glasses or something.  Dad:  That would mean instant death.

Can I take a bowl upstairs to Hobbes?  Mom:  No.  I think you&#39;ve had enough.  Calvin:  I didn&#39;t say for me.  I said for Hobbes!  Mom:  Well, I don&#39;t think &quot;Hobbes&quot; needs any either.  Calvin:  Why not?!  Mom:  Um...because tigers need to stay lean and mean.  Calvin:  That&#39;s what she said.  Hobbes:  I&#39;m lean!  I&#39;m mean!  Tell her chocolate pudding makes my coat lustrous.

Why can&#39;t I stay home?  Why do I have to learn?  Why can&#39;t I stay the way I am?  What&#39;s the point of this?  Why do things have to be this way?  Why can&#39;t things be different?  Mom:  Life is full of mysteries, isn&#39;t it?  See you this afternoon.  Calvin:  At 7:00 a.m., mom&#39;s not very philosophical.

I&#39;ve got a great word and it&#39;s on a &quot;double word score&quot; box!  Hobbes:  &quot;Zqfmgb&quot; isn&#39;t a word!  It doesn&#39;t even have a vowel!  Calvin:  It is so a word!  It&#39;s a worm found in New Guinea!  Everyone knows that!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m looking it up.  Calvin:  You do, and I&#39;ll look up that 12-letter word you played with all the Xs and Js!  Hobbes:  What&#39;s your score for zqfmgb?  Calvin:  957.

Calvin:  It&#39;s getting done.  Mom:  Not with you sitting here, it isn&#39;t.  Calvin:  Hobbes is reading my book for me.  After I&#39;m done watching TV, he&#39;ll tell me what the book was about, and I&#39;ll tell him what the TV shows were about!  See, we&#39;re doing twice as much in the same amount of time!  Mom says you should watch TV and I should read the dumb book.  Hobbes:  Ugh, I only like nature documentaries.

Is it an earthquake? No! It&#39;s...It&#39;s a Calvinosaurus! Named after the renowned archeologist who discovered it, the huge Calvinosaur can eat an ultrasaur in a single bite! Calvin: Phooey!

Hobbes:  Oh boy, a shooting trick!  Go!  Here it is!  Wow!  Six clean holes through the ace!  Calvin:  Pretty good, huh?  Want to know how I did it?  I used a hole puncher ahead of time!  Dad:  Hmm, on second thought, I&#39;ll fold.  Man:  Hey, what&#39;s with this deck?!

By holding my arms out stiff and pushing down hard, I found I could suspend myself a few feet above the ground.  I flapped harder, and soon I was soaring effortlessly over the trees and telephone poles!  I could fly!  I folded my arms back and zoomed low over the neighborhood.  Everyone was amazed, and they ran along under me as I shot by.  Then I rocketed up so fast that my eyes watered from the wind.  I laughed and laughed,  making huge loops across the sky!  ...That&#39;s when Mom woke me up and said I was going to miss the bus if I didn&#39;t get my bottom out of bed; 20 minutes later, here I am, standing in the cold rain, waiting to go to school, and I just remembered I forgot my lunch.  Tuesdays don&#39;t start much worse than this.

Calvin:  Hold it.  You know what I&#39;dl like to see?  I&#39;d like to see the three bears eat the three little pigs, and then the bears join up with the big bad wolf and eat goldilocks and little red riding hood!  Tell me a story like that, Ok?  Dad:  And how should Hansel and Gretel meet their untimely demise?  Calvin:  The witch eats them and then the wolf eats the witch.

Dad:  What on Earth for?  It&#39;s 8:00 at night!  Calvin:  I want to pour gasoline in big letters on the lawn.....and set fire to it so airplanes can read it as they fly over!

Calvin: This meeting of the top secret club G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS) will come to order. Today this august assembly will decide whether to demote President Hobbes on charges of heresy! Hobbes: Heresy?! Calvin: Let the record show that the defendant made an undisparaging comment about the possible membership of Susie Derkins, an admitted girl and enemy of this club. Hobbes: Let the record also show that supreme Dictator for Life Calvin is a nincompoop. Calvin: Ok, just for that, you&#39;re also charged with insubordination! This court finds you guilty on both counts and strips you of your title! Hobbes: Ha! As court stenographer I refuse to enter the verdict! In fact, I&#39;m promoting myself to &quot;El Tigre Numero Uno!&quot; Calvin: Oh yeah?! Well then, I promote myself to &quot;most highest grandest, exalted, um, supreme, um....Hobbes: There! I wrote &quot;Hobbes equals great&quot; in the official club notebook! Now it&#39;s a law! Calvin: It is not! gimme that! Calvin: Ha ha ha! I&#39;m writing &quot;Hobbes equals ugly furball!&quot; What do you think of that? Hobbes: Oh ho! I take the supreme dictator hat! Now I&#39;m the supreme dictator! Calvin: You give that back! Hobbes: I declare you null and void! Calvin: Truce! Hobbes: Truce! Calvin: What a great club. Too bad we don&#39;t have more members. Hobbes: Maybe we should allow Susie to join.

Calvin:  No, Hobbes stopped eating canned tuna.  You know, they kill dolphins to get it.  Mom:  OK, I&#39;ll put it back.  So what does Hobbes like now instead?  Calvin:  Fresh swordfish steaks.  He likes them grilled outside.  Mom:  Mm-hmm.  How about peanut butter?

Hobbes is reading my comic books!  Tell him to stop!  I told him to go buy his own, and he snarled at me!  Make him give &#39;em back!  Mom:  Maybe you should be glad he&#39;s more literate than most stuffed animals.  Calvin:  Buy they&#39;re my comic books, not his!  Mom:  Well, you should learn to share.  I don&#39;t think Hobbes will hurt them.  Calvin:  Are you kidding?!  he drew a mustache and glasses on every picture of nuke-man last issue!  In pen!

Hobbes:  Ok. Is it loathsome?  Calvin:  Yes!  Hobbes:  Is it some big centipede with poison pinchers?  Calvin:  Centipedes have poison pinchers?  Hobbes:  I think so.

Yes, do you have any books on homemade bombs?  That&#39;s what I said.  I need a book that lists supplies and gives step-by-step instructions for building, rigging, and detonating them.

You&#39;d better get in the tub now anyway.  Calvin:  A bath?!  But it&#39;s the middle of the afternoon!  Mom:  Yes, but I have to get in the shower before your dad gets home, so he can take one.  Calvin:  Why all the baths?  Is there some epidemic going around?  Mom:  I told you this morning we&#39;re going out tonight.  Rosalyn will be here at 6:00.  Calvin:  AUGHHHH!

Rosalyn will be here in just a few hours!  Hobbes:  Do you think she&#39;ll remember how you locked her outside last time?  Calvin:  If she does, we&#39;re dead!  She&#39;ll probably stick my head on a stake in the front yard as a warning to other kids she baby-sits!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m almost sure that would violate some zoning ordinance.  Calvin:  Well no matter what, we&#39;re in big trouble unless we think of something fast!  Hobbes:  I suppose we could try being good.  Calvin:  I must&#39;ve gotten water in my ear.  What did you say?  Hobbes:  Nothing.  Forget it.

If we step out of line once tonight, Rosalyn will kill us, and then mom and dad will kill us again when they get home.  Hobbes:  I guess that&#39;s that.  Calvin:  What?!  Admit defeat?  Never!

Calvin:  Quick!  Get in the covers!  Pretend we&#39;ve just been reading in bed!  Hobbes:  But she knows you attacked her and ran outside half an hour ago!  Calvin:  That was Stupendous Man.  Not mild-mannered Calvin!  I&#39;ve been in bed with my PJs on since 8:00.  Hobbes:  You think she&#39;s going to believe that?  Calvin:  My covers are here.  My pajamas are here.  It&#39;s as plain as can be!

I found you!  Calvin:  Found??  Why, what do you mean?  I&#39;ve been in bed reading all evening with Hobbes.  Rosalyn:  Don&#39;t give me that!  You just now sneaked inside, took off your silly costume, and jumped in bed!  I know what you did!  Well you&#39;re gonna get it now, bucko!  Calvin:  Oh yeah?  What are you going to do to me, huh?  You can&#39;t send me to bed when I&#39;m already in bed!  Sorry to spoil your fun, you eel!  Rosalyn:  Ok, downstairs!  March!  Calvin:  Hey, you can&#39;t take me out of bed!  I need my sleep!  Hey!  Hey!

Calvin:  Gosh mom, what&#39;s to tell?  At 8:00, I put on my pajamas, brushed my teeth and went straight to bed.  Nothing happened.  Mom:  And this?  Calvin:  Uh...lies!  All lies!  Rosalyn made me do that just so I&#39;d get in trouble!  She hates kids!  None of that is true!  I went straight to bed!  Hobbes:  Nice try, Pinocchio.  Calvin:  Well who would&#39;ve thought Rosalyn would make me write a full confession?!

What injustice!  They think they&#39;ve won, but they haven&#39;t!  I&#39;ll show &#39;em!  I refuse to learn a lesson!  I&#39;m indomitable!  They can&#39;t change me!  I&#39;ll sit in front of the TV all week even if I can&#39;t turn it on!

I don&#39;t understand why time goes slower at great speed.  Dad:  It&#39;s because you keep changing time zones.  See, if you fly to California, you gain three hours on a five-hour flight, right?  So if you go at the speed of light, you gain more time.  Because it doesn&#39;t take as long to get there.  Of course, the theory of relativity only works if you&#39;re going west.  Calvin:  Gee, that&#39;s not what mom said at all!  She must be totally off her rocker.  Dad:  Well, we men are better at abstract reasoning.  Go tell her that.

Mom:  Do what?  Calvin:  See, I&#39;ll put on my roller skates and tie a rope from the car bumper to my waist.  Then when I give you the high five, you patch out while I ride behind at 55 mph!  What do you say?  Can we go?  I sure wish you could drive.

Hobbes: The turbo is pooped. Calvin: That&#39;s ok. Gravity just kicked in. Ever notice how decisions make chain reactions? Hobbes: How so? Calvin: Well, each decision we make determines the range of choices we&#39;ll face next. Take this fork in the road for instance.  Which way should we go? Arbitrarily, I choose left. Now, as a direct result of that decision, we&#39;re faced with another choice: should we jump this ledge or ride along the side of it? If we hadn&#39;t turned left at the fork, this new choice would never have come up.  Hobbes: I note, with some dismay, you&#39;ve chosen to jump the ledge. Calvin: Right. And that decision will give us new choices. Hobbes: Like, should we bail out or die in the landing? Calvin: Exactly.  Our first decision created a chain reaction of decisions. Let&#39;s jump. See? If you don&#39;t make each decision carefully, you never know where you&#39;ll end up.  That&#39;s an important lesson we should learn sometime. Hobbes: I wish we could talk about these things without the visual aids.

Nobody is on the swings!  I can&#39;t believe it!  Ha ha!  I almost never get a swing at recess!  This is great!  No one is telling me to hurry up!  Higher!  Higher!  Whee! ..Either this is my lucky day, or I missed the end-of-recess bell again.

Calvin:  No, why?  Susie:  You must be the only boy who didn&#39;t.  All the others are playing in the back fields.  Calvin:  You mean I&#39;m the only boy on a playground full of girls?!  Susie:  It sure looks like it.  Want to ride on the teeter-totter with me?  Calvin:  Oh no!  I&#39;m in cootie central!  I haven&#39;t had my shots!  Susie:  Relax.  Stupidity produces antibodies.  Calvin:  Air filter!  Air filter!

Don&#39;t you like sports?  Calvin:  I dunno.  I&#39;d just rather run around.  I hate all the rules and organization and teams and ranks in sports.  Somebody&#39;s always yelling at you, telling you where to be, what to do, and when to do it.  I figure when I want that, I&#39;ll join the Army and at least get paid.

Calvin:  I&#39;m not a sisy!  Moe:  Oh yeah?  You&#39;d rather play dolls on the playground with girls.  Calvin:  I wasn&#39;t playing with dolls!  Moe:  Sure you weren&#39;t!  Let me see your Barbie doll, you sissy wimp!  Calvin:  I&#39;m not a wimp!  In fact, I was going to the office to sign up for baseball right now!  Then again, if I&#39;m not a wimp, why am I taking the path of least resistance?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|4|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/04/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/a67217e0dece013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  I signed up to play baseball every recess, and I don&#39;t even like baseball that much.  I mean, it&#39;s fun playing baseball with just you, because we both get to pitch, bat, run and catch all at once.  We get to do everything.  Hobbes:  Mostly we just argue over the rules we make up!  That&#39;s the part I like!  Calvin: But this will be with teams and assigned positions and an umpire!  It&#39;s boring playing it the real way!  Hobbes:  Do you even know how to play the real way?  Calvin:  See, that&#39;s another problem!  Suppose they make me a halfback.  Can I tackle the shortstop or not?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|4|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/04/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/a7a99500dece013171ac005056a9545d|284|900|Dad:  I hear you signed up to play softball at recess.  Calvin: Yeah, but I didn&#39;t even want to.  I just did it to stop getting teased.  Dad:  Well, sports are good for you.  They teach teamwork and cooperation.  You learn how to win graciously and accept defeat.  It builds character.  Calvin:  Every time I&#39;ve built character, I&#39;ve regretted it!  I don&#39;t want to learn teamwork!  I don&#39;t want to learn about winning and losing!  Heck, I don&#39;t even want to compete!  What&#39;s wrong with just having fun by yourself, huh?!  Dad:  When you grow up, it&#39;s not allowed.  Calvin:  All the more reason I should do it now!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|4|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/04/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/98507e90df740131723d005056a9545d|636|900|Mom: Are you going to read Calvin a story? Dad: Only if it&#39;s not that awful &quot;Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie.&quot; Mom: Oh, but you look so cute doing the &quot;Happy Hamster Hop&quot;! Dad: I don&#39;t want to look cute!! Dad: What story would you like tonight, Calvin? Calvin: I want a story about Hobbes and me. Dad: Oh, hmmm. Let&#39;s see... Once there was a boy named Calvin who lived with a tiger named Hobbes.  Calvin: This is great! Dad: Today they got up at the crack of dawn and made a huge ruckus running up the stairs, galump, galump, galump, and sliding down again, bump, bump, bump, bump. Calvin: Yeah, then the big bad dad yelled that if we didin&#39;t knock it off, he&#39;d mail us to Pluto third class! Dad: Who&#39;s telling this story, you or me? Calvin: You did say that! Don&#39;t try to deny it! Dad: So, finally Calvin got the hint and he went to rot his innards with chocolate cereal and to rot his brain watching cartoons. Cavlin: Hey! No editorials! Dad: At last  Calvin and Hobbes went outside, and it was nice and quiet in the house again, at least for a while. Well, good night! Calvin: Good night?! That&#39;s not the end! You didn&#39;t even get us to lunchtime. Dad: That&#39;s right...It&#39;s not the end of the story. This story doesn&#39;t have an end. You and Hobbes will write more of it tomorrow and every day after. But now it&#39;s time to sleep, so good night. Calvin: Oh! OK, good night. Calvin: This is a good story about us if it doesn&#39;t end! That&#39;s the kind of story I like the best! Good night, ol&#39; buddy! Hobbes: Me too! See you tomorrow!

A little practice will make you more confident tomorrow at recess.  Calvin:  I hat these father-son things.  Dad:  Go out a little bit, and I&#39;ll hit you a grounder.  Calvin:  Why did I sign up for this?  I should just move.  Dad:  Ready?  Now, be sure to run up to the ball.  Don&#39;t just let it roll to you.  Are you ok?  Sometimes the ball bounces up like that, and you&#39;ve got to be ready.  Calvin:  Thags for the tib, dad.  Fide my node and pud id in ice so they can sew id bag od!

Calvin:  It finally stopped bleeding.  I guess that means I&#39;ll have to go to school tomorrow.  My whole life is a disaster.  I get injured just trying to learn the skills it takes to play a game I don&#39;t even want to play!  Hobbes:  Your nose is probably all clogged up now, huh?  Calvin:  *Snrkk* Yeah, why?  Hobbes:  If you snore, I&#39;m tilting the bed so you roll out the window.  Calvin:  It&#39;s always nice to have a sympathetic friend to talk to.

Did you sign up for recess baseball?  Calvin:  Yeah, don&#39;t remind me.  You&#39;re lucky that girls don&#39;t have to put up with this nonsense.  If a girl doesn&#39;t want to play sports, that&#39;s fine!  But if a guy doesn&#39;t spend his afternoons chasing some stupid ball, he&#39;s called a wimp!  You girls have it easy!  Susie:  On the other hand, boys aren&#39;t expected to spend their lives 20 pounds underweight.  Calvin:  And if you don&#39;t play sports, you don&#39;t get to make beer commercials!

I&#39;m Calvin.  I&#39;m supposed to be on team five now.  Mr. Lockjaw:  Oh yes, you&#39;re the one who signed up late.  Hmm...ok, you go play left field.  Calvin:  Left field.  Ok, I know that.  Let&#39;s see, if I&#39;m here, then left field would be...  Mr. Lockjaw:  That way.  Play deep left field.  Calvin:  I guess this is pretty deep.

I&#39;ve been standing out here in deep left field all this time, and not a single ball has come out here!  Actually, I suppose that&#39;s just as well.  I don&#39;t know what base to throw to anyway.  In fact, I&#39;m not even sure that I can throw that far.  Hey, what&#39;s everyone doing?  Are people switching teams, or what?  The guys at bat are now out here!  Well.  I&#39;m sure someone would tell me if I was supposed to be doing anything different.

They tried to make me learn, but I was too tough for &#39;em! I&#39;m home! Hobbes: Why hello, Calvin! Do come in, won&#39;t you? Calvin: Hey! Hey! Hobbes: May I read all your comic books? I may? Thank you, Calvin!May I draw mustaches on all the superheroes? I may? Oh joy! Calvin: I&#39;ll get him for this if it takes my whole life.

There&#39;s no hope of rescue from this bleak and isolated world!  Oh, what a desolate place to be trapped!  Spiff tries desperately to repair his disabled spacecraft!  Person:  High fly to left field!  Who&#39;s out there?!  Calvin:  Our hero pauses.  There&#39;s some commotion on the horizon.  Aliens!  Spiff grabs his blaster!

Calvin:  I&#39;m just a natural athlete, I guess.  Young boy 1:  Hey, who&#39;s he?  Young boy 2:  Isn&#39;t he on the other team?

Young boy 2:  It&#39;s Calvin!  Calvin:  Heck, it was nothing, guys.  When you&#39;re in top physical condition like me, you can...  Young boy 1:  You moron!  What were you doing in the outfield?!  It&#39;s a new inning!  We&#39;re up to bat!  Calvin:  Huh?  Young boy 1:  You caught the ball for the wrong team!  You got our own guy out!  What a dweeb!  What a jerk!  What an idiot!  Calvin:  Oops.  I dropped the catch.  It doesn&#39;t count now, right?  Young boy 2:  Get him off our team, Mr. Lockjaw!  Young boy 1:  Can I hit him with the bat?  Please?  Please??

Young boy 2:  What were you doing in the outfield?  Don&#39;t you even know how to play?!  Calvin:  C&#39;mon guys, it&#39;s just a game!  This is supposed to be fun!  Young boy 2:  Games are only fun when you win, bonehead!  You&#39;re gonna make us lose!  Young boy 1:  If you screw up again, you&#39;re dead meat, Calvin!  Young boy 2:  Wait till I tell the other teams about this!  Young boy 3:  Who taught you how to play anyway?  Your grandmother?  Calvin:  Mr. Lockjaw, I don&#39;t want to play any more.  There&#39;s too much team spirit.  Mr. Lockjaw:  Ok, quitter!  Goodbye.

The kids teased me when I didn&#39;t play baseball.  Then they yelled at me when I did play.  Then the teacher called me a &quot;quitter&quot; when I stopped playing.  Unless you&#39;re a star, you can&#39;t please anyone.  Hobbes:  In that case, why not just please yourself?  Calvin:  Because mom won&#39;t let me move to Madagascar.

What do you want to do?  Calvin:  Anything but play an organized sport.  Hobbes:  Want to play Calvinball?  Calvin:  Yeah!  Hobbes:  No sport is less organized than Calvinball!  Calvin:  New rule!  New rule!  If you don&#39;t touch the 30-yard base wicket with the flag, you have to hop on one foot!

Yes, you heard right!  Equally amazing is my own story of yesterday afternoon, when I actually died of boredom!  I was doing my homework, when suddenly I collapsed!  I felt myself rising, and I could see my crumpled body on the floor.  I drifted up in a shaft of light and I entered the next world!  Eventually, my heart started again and I came back to life...but not before bringing this back!  Young child:  A yo-yo?  Calvin:  It was pretty boring there, too.  Miss Wormwood:  Let&#39;s have a look at that homework.

Miss Wormwood:  Calvin, pay attention!  Calvin:  Augh!  There&#39;s no head rest on this chair!  I should sue for whiplash!

Mom:  Funny?  What do you mean?  Calvin:  Well, tickly maybe...or scratchy?  Anything like a bite or a sting?  Mom:  Why?  And what have you got behind your back?!  Calvin:  Um...here, you may want these.  Well, heh heh, gotta run!  Dad:  Women!  Always changing their clothes!  Mom:  After I get that kid, you&#39;re next.

Balancing on two wheels is just as easy as balancing on two fee...Whoa!  Oomf!  Ackk!  Ow!  I&#39;d say that crossed the line from ironic coincidence to evil omen.

I want to have fun.  Too much stress is unhealthy, you know!  Hobbes:  I don&#39;t see why I had to come in.

I call it &quot;effective time management,&quot; or &quot;ETM&quot; for short.  I&#39;ve drawn up a schedule for each school subject, and I use this kitchen timer to monitor my pace.  Thanks to ETM, I&#39;m much more efficient, and my work goes faster!  ETM:  RINGG!  Calvin:  There!  My math minute is up!  Set the clock for my spelling assignment, ok?  Hobbes:  Um, your schedule calls for smaller time increments than this clock can measure.

Hobbes:  It&#39;s like a paper boy.  You know, a tiger with a newspaper route.  Calvin:  Oh.  This book makes no sense at all.

Dad:  No, you&#39;d have to eat a bucket of bugs before I&#39;d pay you a dollar.  Calvin:  A whole bucket?  Dad:  Or I&#39;d pay you a dollar to pick up sticks in the back yard.  Calvin:  All my real skills are undervalued.

The incredible spaceman spiff zooms to the surface of annoole-4! Touching down, our hero sets off to searow for sentient life! Alas, spaceman spiff only discovers a hideous blob so monumentally stupid that it just stares straight ahead, completely unaware of anything around it! Compassionately, our hero decides to put the blob out of it&#39;s misery. Spiff stes his blastter on &quot;liquify.&quot; Susie Derkins: Eww! Miss Wormwood! Calvin&#39;s shooting spit balls! Calvin: perplexed by the blobs restience, Spiff adds more juice and prepares to fire again!

Calvin:  I don&#39;t want to go!  Put me down! On distant planet Zark, we find the empty red spacecraft of our hero, the bold Spaceman Spiff!  Uh oh!  Up ahead, the rocks are charred with death ray blasts!  A violent struggle took place here!  And only the tracks of a large, sinister alien leave the scene!  What has happened to the earthling explorer?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|5|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/05/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/c86a3450dece013171ac005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  Spaceman Spiff is being held prisoner by hideous aliens!  What do they want with him?  Spiff is soon to find out!  Our hero is called before the alien potentate!  Where it becomes clear that Spiff is about to be sacrificed...To appease the evil god they call &quot;Nollij&quot;!  Miss Wormwood:  Up to the blackboard.  Hurry up.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|5|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/05/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/c9aaf5b0dece013171ac005056a9545d|282|900|Calvin:  Staring death in the face, our hero thinks fast.  Inching closer to the sacrificial pit, Spiff slowly and smoothly reaches for the tiny atom blaster concealed in his belt!  Yaa!  All right, you bloodsucking, mutant chromosomal disasters!  Nobody move!  I&#39;m outta here!  Miss Wormwood:  Calvin, give me that rubber band right this minute!  Calvin:  I said nobody move!

The dank and smelly corridors of the alien fortress are deserted!  All the aliens had gathered for the spectacle of our hero&#39;s demise!  The fearless space explorer makes it to the planet surface, but the alien queen is in pursuit!  Miss Wormwood:  Calvin, get back here!  Calvin:  Spiff jumps into the cockpit, pressurizes the launch thrusters, and...blasts off!  Our hero is safe! Tomorrow:  Or is he??

What are you doing home?!  It&#39;s not even noon!  Calvin:  Uh, they let us out early today.  There was, um, a gas leak.  Mom:  What?!  Does anyone know you left?!  I&#39;m calling the school.  Calvin:  Don&#39;t waste your time!  Everyone was evacuated!  There&#39;s nobody there!  Mom:  Hello?  Elementary school office, please.  Calvin:  Our hero hadn&#39;t counted on running into a Zark enforcer ship!  Spiff&#39;s evasive maneuvers come to naught!  This could be the end!

Mom hit the roof when she found out I just left school.  Hobbes:  What happened?  Calvin:  She drove me back and we had to talk to my teacher and the principal!  They talked about my study habits, and now I&#39;ve got extra homework!  Hobbes:  Ooh.  Calvin:  And dad is going to check it every night to make sure it&#39;s done right!  Can you believe it?!  So try to do an extra good job now, ok?  Hobbes:  You&#39;re lucky tigers are so smart.

Hobbes:  Hey!  Calvin:  Ha ha!  I stole your flag!  Hobbes:  But I hit you with the Calvin ball!  You have to put the flag back and sing the &quot;I&#39;m very sorry&quot; song!  Calvin:  I don&#39;t have to sing the song!  I was in the &quot;No song&quot; zone!  Hobbes:  No you weren&#39;t.  I touched the &quot;opposite pole&quot;, so the &quot; No song zone&quot; is now a &quot;Song zone&quot;  Calvin:  I didn&#39;t see you touch the opposite pole!  You have to declare it!  Hobbes:  I declared it oppositely by not declaring it.  Start singing.  Calvin:  &quot;Here&#39;s the &quot;very sorry songg;  Won&#39;t you help and sing alongg?  Hobbes:  Bum bum bum.  Calvin : I blew it!...I knew it!...So sorry! I&#39;m very very sorry that I took your precious flaaggg!  Hobbes:  He&#39;s sorry!  So sorry!  Just don&#39;t do it any more, you scurvy scalawaaggg!  Calvin:  I&#39;m free!  I get free passage to wicket five!  Hobbes:  No, that&#39;s what we did last time, remember?  Calvin:  Oh, yeah umm...  OK, the new rule is we have to jump everywhere until someone finds the bonus box!  Hobbes:  That&#39;s good!  Calvin:  The only permanent rule in Calvinball is that you can&#39;t play it the same way twice!  Hobbes:  The score is still 0 to 12!

Are they real??  Have they landed in our towns and neighborhoods?  Do the chilling photographs by an amateur photographer really show a sinister alien spaceship and the grim results of a close encounter, or are the pictures an elaborate hoax?  Listen to an expert on space aliens speculate on their hideous biology and their horrifying weaponry!  All this and more...on Calvin&#39;s show and tell...Next!  Miss Wormwood:  Calvin, will you come here please?

Thank you, thank you.  Hobbes:  Sheesh.

Well, that gave me this great idea!  I&#39;ve decided to become a forger and get rich passing off fake paintings to museums!  A lot of paintings sell for tens of millions of dollars now, so I make a pretty good hourly rate.  Hobbes:  You should probably scratch out the copyright date on the cartoon stationery.  Calvin:  Ooh yeah, glad you caught that!

This story doesn&#39;t have any shoot-ups in it, does it?  Dad:  You mean guns?  No.  Calvin:  Any violence at all?  Dad:  Um...not really.  Calvin:  Any references to satanism?  Any profanity?  Any car chases?  Any lewd parts?  Dad:  Of course not!  Calvin:  What makes you think I&#39;ll like this?

Wiith one sip from this ordinary can of soda, I can burp for almost ten seconds straight!  Mom:  Calvin, I don&#39;t...  Calvin:  But that&#39;s not all!  At the same time, I&#39;ll also recite a gross limerick I learned at school!...ready?  Hobbes:  Maybe if you recited the Gettysburg address...  Calvin:  Forget it.  My talents are wasted on her kind.

Good morning sleepyhead!  You&#39;ve missed the best part of the day!  I&#39;ve been up since 6:30 getting many things accomplished!  Calvin:  At least when I have a day off, I can tell the difference.  Dad:  I just know some nurse switched the bassinets.

Calvin:  Great moons of Neptune!  A fool mortal female!  Susie:  Calvin?  Calvin:  I&#39;m not Calvin!  I&#39;m Stupendous Man!  Friend of freedom!  Opponent of oppression!  Susie:  Uh huh.  What are you doing?  Calvin:  I was just about to use my stupendous powers to liberate some cookies being held hostage on the top shelf of the pantry!  Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, duty calls!  A bolt of crimson streaks across the sky!  The man of mega-might is off to save the day!  Susie&#39;s Mom:  Did they have an egg you could borrow?  Susie:  No one was home, Mom.

I&#39;ll show you something interesting.  Compare a point on the label with a point on the record&#39;s outer edge.  They both make a complete circle in the same amount of time, right?  Calvin:  Yeah...  Dad:  But the point on the record&#39;s edge has to make a bigger circle in the same time.  So it goes faster.  See, two points on one disk move at two speeds, even though they both make the same revolutions per minute!

Calvin:  Hi dad!  Dad:  Calvin, is this important?  Calvin:  Oops.  Wait.  Forget I called you &quot;dad&quot;, ok?  This isn&#39;t Calvin.  Dad:  Calvin, I&#39;ve got work to do.  I&#39;ll see you when I get home, ok?  Goodbye.  Calvin:  Wait!  Do you have any crimes to report?  Phooey.  This secret identity stuff is hard to get used to.

I&#39;ve got a baby tooth that&#39;s just hanging by a thread...and I can turn it all the way around with my tongue...or make it swing from side to side!  See?  See?  They&#39;re all just jealous.

I&#39;m happy but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m ecstatic.  Life is like topography, Hobbes.  There are summits of happiness and success...flat stretches of boring routine and valleys of frustration and failure.  But I&#39;m dedicating myself to experiencing only peaks!  I want my life to be one never ending ascension! Each minute of every day should bring me greater joy than the previous minute!  I should always be saying &quot; My life is better than I ever imagined it would be, and I&#39;ts only going to improve.&quot;  I&#39;m just going to jump from peak to peak!  I&#39;m...whoops.  Hobbes:  At least with flat places, you don&#39;t have so far to go down.  Calvin:  Only losers go down!  For me, it&#39;s only going to be up and up!

Mom:  You don&#39;t look so good.  Let me feel your forehead.  Calvin:  Summer vacation started!  I can&#39;t be sick!  Mom:  Your head&#39;s hot.  I&#39;ll get the thermometer.  Calvin:  No!  I refuse!  Forget it!  I hate thermometers!  I still don&#39;t believe her that these things take two hours to register.  Mom:  Now be nice and quiet and I&#39;ll check on you this afternoon.

Calvin:  Chicken pox?!  Mom, what is this guy?  A veterinarian?!  Doctor:  The virus should run its course in about a week.  Calvin:  He&#39;s mad!  Mad, I say!  I&#39;ll bet the real doctor is tied up and gagged in the other exam room!  Doctor:  He&#39;s extremely contagious, so keep him away from other kids.  Calvin:  Sue him, mom!  Drive his malpractice insurance up!  Mom:  Calvin has to be inside for a week??  Doctor:  That&#39;s a nasty twitch you&#39;ve developed.  Calvin:  Hey doc, for 10 bucks I&#39;ll make sure you see those kids in the waiting room again real soon!

Calvin:  Hi Susie!  It&#39;s me Calvin!  I was wondering if you&#39;d like to come over and play.  Susie:  Why sure!  Boy, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever invited me to...  Mom:  Calvin, what are you doing?  Calvin:  Nothing, mom.  Go away.  Mom:  You&#39;re contagious!  You can&#39;t have anyone over to play!  Calvin:  Shh!  Shh!  You&#39;ll spoil the whole thing!  I was going to trick Susie into catching...hey!  Let go!  Ow!  (click)  Susie:  Any chance of getting transferred, dad?

Calvin:  Right.  You&#39;re absolutely positive tigers can&#39;t catch chicken pox?  Mom:  Go back to bed, Calvin.

Mom:  That&#39;s good.  Calvin:  Well, just remember that this week doesn&#39;t count.  Mom:  Doesn&#39;t count?  Calvin:  Right.  Summer vacation days don&#39;t count if you&#39;re sick.  I get to start school a week later now, so I get my full allotment of vacation.  OK, what&#39;s the next amendment say?  I know it&#39;s in here someplace.

Everything has suddenly turned neo-cubist!  It all started when Calvin engaged his Dad in a minor debate!  Soon Calvin could see both sides of the issue!  Then poor Calvin began to see both sides of everything!  The traditional single viewpoint has been abandoned!  Perspective has been fractured!  The multiple views provide too much information!  It&#39;s impossible to move!  Calvin quickly tries to eliminate all but one perscpective!  It works!  The world falls into a recognizable order!  You&#39;re still wrong, Dad.

There&#39;s a TV show I want to see.  Mom:  We&#39;re still eating dinner, Calvin.  Calvin:  I&#39;m through.  This stuff was awful.  I want to go watch television.  Mom:  It&#39;s impolite to leave the table in the middle of a meal.  Calvin:  So what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch you guys chew?!  I&#39;ll miss my show!  Mom:  Your TV show isn&#39;t as important as spending some time together as a family.  Calvin:  We&#39;ll compromise.  I&#39;ll go watch a sitcom family.  Dad:  In a minute you&#39;re going to discover the difference between those and real life.

I&#39;m missing my show!  Dad:  I&#39;m sure your instinct will kick in shortly.  Calvin:  What&#39;s the big deal about dinner?!  Why can&#39;t I go watch TV?  Lots of people watch TV while they eat!  Dad:  Calvin, dinner is the one time during the day that we set aside to be together and talk.  There&#39;s more to being a family than just living in the same house.  We need to interact once in a while.  Calvin:  We could all argue over what channel to watch.  Dad:  You know what I mean.

I hope you&#39;re happy.  Dad:  You shouldn&#39;t be planning your life around the TV anyway.  Calvin:  Hmph.  Dad:  Look, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to ask that we sit together for 40 minutes without distractions and interruptions.  Phone:  Rinngg!  Mom:  I&#39;ll get it!  I&#39;m expecting a call.  Calvin:  Go ahead, dad.  I believe you were saying something funny.  Dad:  I have all these great genes, but they&#39;re recessive.  That&#39;s the problem here.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|6|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/06/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e8ce0460dece013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  C&#39;mon Hobbes, we have to go outside.  Hobbes:  We have to?  Calvin:  Yeah, dad won&#39;t let me watch TV.  He says it&#39;s summer.  It&#39;s light late, and I should go run around instead of sitting in front of the tube.  Can you believe it?!  What a dictator!  Hobbes:  How cruel it is to be forced to play.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll show him.  I refuse to have fun.

Hobbes:  This race will determine the championship of the universe.  Calvin:  Oh...wait.  How long have we been out here?  Hobbes:  I dunno.  An hour maybe.  Calvin:  Really?  Geez.  Where does the time go?!  Hang on, I&#39;ll be right back.  I&#39;m not having fun!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|6|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/06/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/eb3dcbf0dece013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Dad:  It&#39;s getting dark, Calvin.  Time to come in and go to bed!  Calvin:  But Hobbes and I were catching fireflies.  Can&#39;t we stay out a little longer?  Dad:  Ha!  First you didn&#39;t want to go out, and now you don&#39;t want to come in!  See, by not watching TV, you had more fun, and now you&#39;ll have memories of something real you did, instead of something fake you just watched.  Calvin:  Nothing spoils fun like finding out it builds character.

Calvin:  Boy, some vacation this summer is!

We&#39;re going to get rich!  Hobbes:  Oh no, I&#39;m not getting in that box.  I don&#39;t want to be transmogrified or duplicated or whatever.  Calvin:  What?  When the top is open, it&#39;s a time machine, remember?  Hobbes:  Even worse.  Calvin:  Oh, don&#39;t be such a baby.  The way you act, you&#39;d think the dinosaur actually got us last time.  Why, it wasn&#39;t even a carnivore.  Hobbes:  I don&#39;t care.  You and that box are plain bad news.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|6|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/06/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/edc77e50dece013171ac005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Too bad you&#39;re not going back to the Jurassic with me.  An opportunity like this doesn&#39;t come along every day, you know.  Hobbes:  The less often, the better, is what I say.  Calvin:  We&#39;re just going on a photo safari!  When we come back with real dinosaur photos, we&#39;ll get rich!  Hobbes:  You can drop the &quot;we&quot; stuff.  I&#39;m not going.  Calvin:  Ok, well, I guess I&#39;ll have to eat all these great snacks myself then.  Hobbes:  Snacks?  What kind of snacks?  Are they good snacks?  How many snacks did you bring??  Calvin:  Never mind!  You said you&#39;re not going.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|6|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/06/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/ef024760dece013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Hobbes:  I guess if we get to have snacks, it would be ok to time travel. If they&#39;re good snacks, I mean.  Calvin:  Great!  Put on your vortex goggles.  The dial is set for 140 million years ago, so off we go-o-o!  Hobbes:  I have a question.  Why don&#39;t we get younger as we go back in time, and disappear as we pass the day we were born?  Calvin:  I&#39;d explain it, but there&#39;s a lot of math.  Hobbes:  I thought you got a &quot;D&quot; in math.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|6|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/06/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f03d85a0dece013171ac005056a9545d|288|900|Hobbes:  Is it time for snacks yet?  Calvin:  Hobbes, we&#39;re traveling at light speed through an interdimensional continuum lapse!  Wait till we land!  Hobbes:  Ok, I&#39;ll just inventory the snacks and record them in the journal.  Calvin:  You could help me drive, you know!  If we miss our exit, we could fly right into the Big Bang!  Hobbes:  What would happen then?  Calvin:  There&#39;d be no universe, and probably no time!  Hobbes:  I think we should eat the snacks now.  Calvin:  Sit still, will you?  You&#39;ll make me swerve.

We&#39;re in the Jurassic!  We made it!  Hobbes:  Ugh.  I can&#39;t believe you wanted to come back here.  Calvin:  Last time we didn&#39;t bring a camera.  All we need is a few good dinosaur photos and we&#39;ll be rich when we get home.  Hobbes:  If we get in National Geographic, maybe I&#39;ll get to meet some of those Tigress babes they showed in the April issue!  Yow wow!  Calvin:  Those were females?  Really, I don&#39;t know how you can even tell the difference.

Here&#39;s a chance to get a picture of some Stegosaurs!  See, these photos will answer hundreds of questions about dinosaur anatomy and behavior!  Paleontologists will pay through the nose to see these!  Hobbes:  Take a picture of this one.  He&#39;s smiling.  Calvin:  Just a minute.  Just a minute.

Ok, here&#39;s the game.  We toss the water balloon back and forth, but each time we catch it, we take a step back.  The idea is to see how far apart we can get before one of us gets soaked.  Hobbes:  Gotcha.  Calvin:  Ok, toss it to me.  There, I caught it!  Now we take a step back and I&#39;ll toss it to you.  Ha ha! Catch this, sucker!  Ha ha ha!  What a chump!  What a natf!  Ha ha ha!  Hey!  What&#39;s the matter?  Can&#39;t you take a joke?!  It was a joke! I mean, it was an accident! I didn&#39;t do it on purpose!  Hey! No! Not the rain barrel!  It&#39;s no fun to play games with a poor sport.

Calvin:  An Allosaur!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m right here.  You don&#39;t need to shout.  Calvin:  Run!  When we get to the time machine throw him the snacks we packed!  Maybe that will divert him while we take off!  Hobbes:  You can throw your snacks.  I might still want mine.  Calvin:  You&#39;re going to be a snack yourself!  Get in!  Get in!

Throw him the food!  Hobbes:  My sandwich had mustard.  Is this one yours?  Calvin:  Put on your vortex goggles!  We&#39;re taking off!  Hobbes:  Eww, this banana is mushy.  He can have this.  Calvin:  We did it!  We&#39;re off!  Hobbes:  Here.  Calvin:  Boy, that was a close call, but it will be worth it when we get these pictures developed.  Hobbes:  Since I rescued your sandwich, can I eat it?

Mom:  I saw where you were.  You were playing in a cardboard box out back.  Calvin:  Nope!  That&#39;s just what it looked like.  We time-traveled to the Jurassic, but we returned at the split second we left!  That&#39;s why it didn&#39;t look like we were gone!  We saw lots of dinosaurs!  Mom:  Well, you&#39;ve had a productive morning then.  Calvin:  Yeah.  Will you take this film to be developed?  I&#39;ll pay you back when Time magazine coughs up for my story.

We got our pictures back from our Jurassic trip!  Hobbes:  Oh boy!  Let&#39;s see!  Calvin:  Wow, these came out good!  Look at that Apatosaur!  Hobbes:  There&#39;s me!  There&#39;s me!  Calvin:  Yes!  Yes!  We&#39;re rich!  Ha ha!  Now we can get our own apartment!  Hobbes:  This dinosaur blinked.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll buy a car too, but since I can&#39;t drive for another decade, we&#39;ll have to get a chauffeur.  Hobbes:  If we pay him, he has to let us sit up front and beep the horn, right?

Dad:  Beg pardon?  Calvin:  Yep, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m particularly inclined to share my future millions with you.  Here, look.  Dad:  Dinosaurs?  Calvin:  Hobbes and I went to the Jurassic today and came back with these dramatic photographs!  We&#39;re going to be rich!  Dad:  I didn&#39;t realize dinosaurs looked so small and plastic.  Calvin:  Hey, what are you insinuating?!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|7|7|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/07/07|https://assets.amuniversal.com/fa344180dece013171ac005056a9545d|283|900|Calvin:  Dad doesn&#39;t believe we went to the Jurassic and took photographs of real dinosaurs.  He says it looks like we just put my toy models in the yard and took pictures of them!  He says our get-rich-quick scheme won&#39;t work.  Hobbes:  Huh!  Calvin:  He said if we really wanted to get some money, he&#39;d pay us a dollar to pull weeds out of the front walk.  Hobbes:  Just a dollar?  Calvin:  Of course I told him we didn&#39;t want the money that bad.

Calvin:  No! You can&#39;t have any!  It&#39;s mine! All mine! The late cretaceous...when the world meant business. A gigantic quetzncoatlus, a pterosaur the size of an airplane swoops over the horrible tyrannosaurus!  The tyrannosaur lunges and brings down the flying pest! Uh oh!  The commotion attracts other tyrannosaurs, greedy for an undeserved piece!  Driven away by the fierce roaring and gnashing of the intruders, the tyrannosaur nurses a deep grudge.  Revenge will soon be his!

Mom:  What?!  Calvin:  You know, where would the steaks be?  Would legs be like drumsticks?  Would kids be like veal?  Mom:  Ughh!  Go be disgusting somewhere else!  Out!  Calvin:  Some people just don&#39;t have inquisitive minds.

I wonder why that is.  I would think that the less life you had left, the faster you&#39;d want to do everything, so you could pack more into the remaining years.  You can bet when I&#39;m a geezer like Dad, I&#39;ll be going like a maniac.  Hobbes:  Oh great.

Calvin:  That darn bicycle tried to kill me!  Dad:  You fell off?  Calvin:  I took me 40 minutes to subdue it to the point where I could climb on, and then it bucked me right over the handlebars!  Dad:  You fell off.  Calvin:  Then it tried to run me over!  It&#39;s out to kill me!  I&#39;m lucky to be alive!  Dad:  Well, balancing takes a little practice.  Calvin:  Do you have a rifle?  Will you shoot it?

Uh oh! In another of life&#39;s mysterious quirks, Calvin finds himself an inch tall on the writing desk!  His only hope is to tear off a sheet from a nearby pad of paper!  At his tiny size, folding the sheet is difficult, but soon Calvin&#39;s patience is rewarded!  He pushes off and catches a small thermal rising up the front of the desk! A gust from an open window sends Calvin soaring across the house!  There&#39;s Dad! Lean! Lean!  Yes, Calvin is able to steer!  This should get Dad&#39;s attention!  I don&#39;t need parents.  All I need is a recording that says, &quot;Go play outside!&quot;

What are you doing down there?  Calvin:  Shh!  Shh!  Get down!  Be quiet!  Have you seen my bicycle?  Susie Derkins:  No...  Calvin:  Thank goodness.  If my bike doesn&#39;t get me first, I&#39;m going to cut all its spokes in two.  You never saw me today, got it?  Susie Derkins:  Our class voted Calvin the &quot;Most likely to be seen on the news some day.&quot;

See?  Nice oil?  Wouldn&#39;t you like some?  Easy...easy...  Bike:  Rrrr  Calvin:  Yaa!  I&#39;ve got you now!  You&#39;re going to the scrap heap, you rabid pile of rusty...  Dad:  I never got my face caught in the chain when I learned to ride a bike.  Mom:  Really, how did this happen?  Calvin:  I told you!  Ow!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|7|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/07/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/0595c890decf013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  That stupid bicycle!  I hate it!  I&#39;m never going to ride one as long as I live.  W-what&#39;s that??  Aughh!  My bicycle has been lying in wait!  It&#39;s coming to get me!  Help!  Help!  S-see?  It&#39;s trying to k-kill me!  Mom:  It was just a dream, Honey.  ...But why on Earth did you bring your bike upstairs to your closet?

Calvin:  The garage??  Are you mad?  Mom:  I will be, if you don&#39;t hop to it.  Calvin:  But that&#39;s where my killer bicycle is!  I can&#39;t go out there!  It&#39;ll jump me!  Mom:  I don&#39;t want any nonsense.  Just do what I asked, ok?  Bike:  Rrrrr  Calvin:  I wonder how far from this house my savings would get me.

Hobbes!  Hobbes:  What are you doing up there?  Calvin:  Hiding from my killer bicycle.  It can&#39;t climb trees, so I guess I&#39;ll stay here the rest of my life.  Hobbes:  You should just wedge a big stick through the spokes of the front wheel.  That way when the stick hits the fork, the wheel will jam and the bike will flip over.  Calvin:  Hey, that&#39;s a great idea!  Hobbes, you&#39;re a lifesaver!  Hobbes:  We could mosey over to the kitchen if you&#39;re wondering how you can possibly thank me enough.

I did just what you said!  I put a stick in the spokes of my killer bicycle!  When it tried to chase me, it flipped over!  I wrestled it to exhaustion, and then I let the air out of its tires!  Ha!  I guess that nasty ol&#39; thing won&#39;t be coming after me any more!  We&#39;re too smart for it!  Man triumphs over machine!  Mom:  Training wheels!  What a good idea!  Dad:  I pumped up his tires too.  They were both flat.

Calvin:  Booger balls are illegal!  First base!  Fifth!  Ninth!  Puff. Puff. Eleventh!  Puff.  Twenty-fifth!  Calvin&#39;s going for home!  Hobbes:  Too late! You&#39;re out!  Calvin:  I think we need to change the rules.  Hobbes:  Oh, you want to play the sissy way now, I bet.

I suppose you&#39;re wondering how you&#39;re doing in the polls.  Dad:  Not really.  Calvin:  I think you&#39;ll find this chart quite revealing.  This line represents the &quot;average dad approval rating&quot; of 70%.  This overlay shows your approval rating at just under 10%!  Household six-year-olds were polled on their favorite bedtimes.  Watch on these successive overlays how your rating would improve with each hour later!  See, by midnight, you&#39;re right up to normal!  These findings suggest a logical course of action.  Dad:  How long do you spend making these charts?

This fur coat must have made him perspire.  It lies on the floor - should this be construed as a permanent change of attire?  Perhaps he considers its colors passe, or maybe it fit him too snug will he want it back?  Should I put it away?  Or use it right here as a rug?  Hobbes:  Z.  I wonder when school starts.

They don&#39;t realize I&#39;m a card-carrying genius.  Hobbes:  You have a card?  Calvin:  Oh absolutely.  See, it says, &quot;Calvin, certified genius.&quot;  Hobbes:  Wow, you have a certificate?  Calvin:  Well, not really, but no one ever checks those things.  I just say it&#39;s at the frame shop.  Hobbes:  Pretty smart.  Calvin:  I&#39;m a genius.  Hobbes:  How did you emboss this card?  With a screwdriver?

Ants run everywhere!  It&#39;s like they all think they have to be somewhere on time!  See, they never just walk or poke along.  They go everywhere at top speed!  That silly?  C&#39;mon around back.  I&#39;ll show you something else!

What a beautful summer day...and I&#39;ve got to spend it in an office.  Brother.  It seems like I&#39;m always rushing off and never taking the time to enjoy days like this.  I&#39;d sure like to have a quiet day around the house.  No traffic, no schedule, no phone calls..Boy, that would be great.  I could spend some time with Calvin, read a book, go on a bike ride...maybe I should take the day off.  The world wouldn&#39;t end if I didn&#39;t go into the office today.  Days like this don&#39;t come often and life is short.  Calvin:  Hi, Dad.  Bye, Dad.  Dad:  Aughh  Mom:  You get back here and pick every one of those dead bugs out of my shampoo!! I mean now!

Suddenly there&#39;s a blinding flash of light!  It&#39;s Calvin the lightning bolt!  In a fraction of a second, the house below will be in a million pieces!  Mom:  I know it&#39;s raining out, but play a board game or something.

Mom:  Your eyes are fine!  You don&#39;t need contacts.  Calvin:  Yes I do!  They have some that change the color of your eyes!  Mom:  Your eyes are very pretty the way they are.  Calvin:  But if I had contacts, I could make one eye blood red and the other yellow striped, like a bug.  I dunno, it seems like once people grow up, they have no idea what&#39;s cool.

Fortunately, that was our plan from the start.

King of jungle!  Susie:  Nice underpants.  Does your mom know you&#39;re over here like this?  Calvin:  I don&#39;t think Jane ever said that to Tarzan.

Heh heh heh hee hee Hobbes:  Looking for someone?  Uh, who? Me??  Ha ha ha ha ha! Um, no-o.  I mean, yes, but someone else.  Heh heh. Not you.  Hobbes:  Here&#39;s a hypothetical question you should ask yourself.  If you knew today was your last day on earth, what would you do different?  Expecially if, by doing something different, today might not be your last day one earth.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t think that question was very hypothetical at all.

Why don&#39;t you wear short pants?  What&#39;s the matter?  What did I say?  Calvin:  Short pants touch my feet, OK?!!

Hobbes:  At least 15 minutes plus drying.  Calvin:  Sighhh...  I&#39;m bored.  There&#39;s nothing to do.  Mom:  Nothing to do?!!... It&#39;s a beatiful summer day!  You&#39;ve got the whole out-doors to play in!  If you can&#39;t find something to do, it&#39;s because you haven&#39;t tried.  Go on!  Use some imagination.  Calvin:  My upbringing is filled with inconsistent messages.

Dad:  Sure.  That&#39;s first on our bill of rights.  Calvin:  So you would be against censorship and the suppression of ideas you found distasteful.  Dad:  Right.  You&#39;ve got to take the bad with the good.  Calvin:  So you wouldn&#39;t object to me being exposed to art, movies or music that some people think is offensive and shocking, right?  Dad:  Ok, first let me explain about our responsibility to be culturally educated and able to make critical distinctions about.  Calvin:  You&#39;re stallllling!

Dad:  Well, Thoreau says, &quot;simplify, simplify.&quot;  Maybe we need to do that.  Mom:  But how?  Calvin:  I hate it when they look at me that way.

Calvin:  I did!  Mom:  Well, you didn&#39;t do a very good job then.  It looks as messy as it did before.  You should take pride in what you do, and always do the best job possible.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t need to do a better job.  I need better p.r. on the job I do.

Now club secretary General Hobbes will review the minutes.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s 10:32.  Calvin:  Thank you.  At this time we&#39;ll have a field report from Top Scout Calvin!  Hobbes:  You can tell this is a great club because we have so many officers.

Hobbes:  What news, scout?  Calvin:  The enemy has been sighted on the sidewalk two doors down, Mr. President.  Hobbes:  The enemy?  Calvin:  Susie Derkins, an acknowledged girl!  I recommend we establish a strike force!  Hobbes:  Its objective?  Calvin:  To bug her!  Hobbes:  Sounds risky, men.  Any volunteers?

I&#39;ll be the strike force commander.  You&#39;ll be the special agent in charge of munitions.  We&#39;ll fill up a water balloon and sneak up on Susie through the back yard!  Hobbes:  I get to be the official cartographer and map out hiding places and escape routes!  Calvin:  Yeah!  And I&#39;ll be the code expert and make an unbreakable code!  Hobbes:  Oh boy!  Let&#39;s get some paper!  Calvin:  I hope Susie doesn&#39;t go anyplace for a while.  Hobbes:  Ok.  Here&#39;s the United States...

I finished our secret code!  Hobbes:  Let&#39;s see.  Calvin:  I assigned each letter a totally random number, so the code will be hard to crack.  For letter &quot;A&quot;, you write 3, 004, 572, 680.  &quot;B&quot; is 28, 731, 569 1/2.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s a good code all right.  Calvin:  Now we just commit this to memory.  Calvin:  Did you finish your map of our neighborhood?  Hobbes:  Not yet.  How many bricks does the front walk have?

Let&#39;s go soak Susie!  Hobbes:  Our map says first we run to the big tree out back.  Now to the bush out front!  Now to the ditch out back!  Now to the tree out front!  In case you&#39;re wondering...this is to lose anyone who might be tailing us.  Calvin:  I&#39;m writing you a message in code.  How do you spell &quot;nincompoop&quot;?

Calvin:  But where&#39;s Susie?  I don&#39;t see her!  Calvin:  Arghh!  We go to all this trouble to launch an attack on her, and what does she do?  She moves!  All our great plans are for naught!  A whole morning ruined!  Hobbes:  Maybe she just went in for lunch.  See, she left some of her toys out, so she&#39;s probably planning to come back.  Calvin:  That gives me a fabulous idea!  Hobbes:  Uh oh.

Hobbes:  Ok, the score is oogy to boogy. Calvin:  I already had oogy! Hobbes:  You just ran into the invisible sector!  You have to cover your eyes now because everything is invisible to you!  Calvin:  Invisible sector??  I didn&#39;t know we had an invisible sector! Where is it?  Hobbes:  You can&#39;t see it.  It&#39;s invisible.  Calvin:  How do I kow I went in it then?  Hobbes:  You can&#39;t see anything, right?  Calvin:  Ok, so how do I get out?  Hobbes:  Somebody bonks you with the Calvinball!  I get another point!  Calvin:  Hey! Ow! Why you...! That was a rotten rule!  I decree no more invisible sectors!...In fact, I&#39;ll show you!  You just ran into a vortex spot!  You  have to spin around until you fall down.  Hobbes:  Sorry, this vortex spot is in the boomerang zone so the vortex returns to whoever calls it!  You spin!  Calvin:  That&#39;s not fair!  Hobbes:  You know the Calvinball rules.  Calvin:  Yeah, yeah.  Anything we make up.  Well, you&#39;ll pay for this.  This game lends itself to certain abuses.  Hobbes:  Guess how you get out of the boomerang zone!

That&#39;s Susie&#39;s doll.  Calvin:  I know.  C&#39;mon, let&#39;s scram.  Hobbes:  We can&#39;t take her doll!  That would be stealing!  Calvin:  No it wouldn&#39;t.  Hobbes:  Are we going to give it back?  Calvin:  If she pays the ransom!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|8|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/08/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/324087c0decf013171ac005056a9545d|290|900|Susie Derkins:  Hey, where&#39;s Binky Betsy?  I know I left her right here when I went inside.  Did somebody take her?  Everything else is still here.  Where did my doll go?!  Hobbes:  I always like cut-and-paste.  Calvin:  How much should we ask for?  A hundred dollars?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|8|29|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/08/29|https://assets.amuniversal.com/33943360decf013171ac005056a9545d|285|900|Susie Derkins:  Mom, I can&#39;t find my doll.  Have you seen it anywh...hmm, there&#39;s nobody here.  What&#39;s this note?  &quot;Susie, if you want to see your doll again, leave $100 in this envelope by the tree out front.  Do not call the police.  You cannot trace us.  You cannot find us.&quot;  &quot;Sincerely, Calvin.&quot;

That dirty Calvin stole my doll and he wants me to pay $100 to get her back!  Of all the nerve!  He can&#39;t get away with this!  Why, that stinky little...wait!  There&#39;s something else in this envelope.  A photo of Binky Betsy tied to a chair!!  Calvin:  What a great club!  Hobbes:  How are you going to spend your $50?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|8|31|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/08/31|https://assets.amuniversal.com/362084f0decf013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  Let&#39;s stroll down the sidewalk real casually and see if Susie put the hundred bucks out by the tree yet.  Hobbes:  Great!  Calvin:  Lovely day for a stroll, eh Hobbes?  I certainly enjoy my afternoon constitutional!  Hobbes:  Yes, it&#39;s quite invigorating!  Calvin:  Look!  Look!  There&#39;s the envelope!  She did it!  We&#39;re rich!  Hobbes:  Oh boy!  Let&#39;s sneak up and get it!  Susie:  C&#39;mon, you louse.  C&#39;monnn...  Calvin:  I don&#39;t see Susie.  Do you?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/376428c0decf013171ac005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  You stand guard and watch for Susie while I count the money and make sure it&#39;s all there!  Hey, there&#39;s no money in here at all!  There&#39;s just a note!  It says, &quot;Now we&#39;re even!&quot;  Now we&#39;re even??  What&#39;s that supposed to mean?!  Hobbes?  Hobbes!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/dab68c60df740131723d005056a9545d|638|900|Calvin:  Buttons...check. dials...check. Switches...check. Little colored lights...check.  Calvin, the airline pilot, is tenth is line for takeoff. His patience is at an end!  Ignoring the control tower&#39;s protests, Calvin guns the engines and passes the other planes, cutting across less crowded runways!  Rounding a corner, he opens the throttle! Stewardesses explaining the aircraft&#39;s safety features are hurled to the rear of the plane by the sudden acceleration!  All the other planes watch with envy as Calvin takes off ahead of schedule! But what&#39;s this?!  Another plane had already received clearance to land!  It&#39;s headed for the same runway!  It looks like a mid-air collision over a crowded super highway at rush hour! Oh, what a price to pay for his hurry!  Mom:  I&#39;m back!  Thanks for waiting so patiently.  Calvin:  I could wait even longer if you&#39;d buy me a third plane.

Put him down!  Hobbes, bite her!  Bite her!  Susie Derkins:  Ha ha!  Nyahh!  Nyahh!  Get away from our door with that drill!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|4|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/04|https://assets.amuniversal.com/39edb420decf013171ac005056a9545d|279|900|Calvin:  Oooh, that rotten Susie!  I hate her!  I hate her!  She&#39;d better set Hobbes free!  So I kidnapped her stupid doll!  She didn&#39;t need to retaliate!  Can&#39;t she take a joke?!  Girls have no sense of humor!  That&#39;s their whole problem!  All this was funny until she did the same thing to me.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|5|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/05|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3b380470decf013171ac005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  All right, Susie, I brought your dumb doll back!  Now let Hobbes out, ok?  Fair&#39;s fair!  Susie Derkins:  I dunno, Calvin.  I&#39;m thinking I might rather have your tiger.  You can keep Binky Betsy.  Calvin:  Aahh!  I don&#39;t want a doll!  This is yours!  Take it!  Susie Derkins:  Oh, you&#39;ll grow to like her, Calvin.  She has the cutest accessories you can buy!  Calvin:  No!  No!  I want Hobbes!  Take this!  Susie Derkins:  But I think Hobbes likes it better here with me.  Calvin:  He does not!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3c7f6630decf013171ac005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Look Susie, I&#39;ll give you your doll and I&#39;ll give you a quarter, ok?  It&#39;s all I have.  Will you let Hobbes out now??  Susie Derkins:  All right, here.  And next time, leave my stuff alone.  Got it?  Calvin:  Right!  Sure!  Calvin/Susie Derkins:  Jerk.  Calvin:  What kind of tiger are you?!  You didn&#39;t even maul her!  What were you doing there?!  Hobbes:  Wouldn&#39;t you like to know!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|7|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/07|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3dc643c0decf013171ac005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  I&#39;ve got to say, Hobbes, it doesn&#39;t give our club a lot of credit when the first tiger is a willing captive of the enemy.  Hobbes:  Thbptb  Calvin:  We stole her doll, and I&#39;m the one who had to pay ransom!  It&#39;s a disgrace!  You get 15 demerits for besmirching the club&#39;s reputation, plus five demerits for conduct unbecoming an officer, and a censure in the club book for not devouring Susie when you had the chance.  Hmm, anything else?  Hobbes:  I almost told her our code when she rubbed my tummy.  Calvin:  Good gravy, whose side are on?!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3f0bcac0decf013171ac005056a9545d|283|900|Calvin:  Well, this is certainly a sorry chapter in G.R.O.S.S. history!  First Tiger Hobbes, a traitor to the cause!  Hobbes:  It might interest you to know that after I won Susie&#39;s confidence, I did some spying.  Calvin:  Spying?  You were a spy??  Hobbes:  I read an open page of Susie&#39;s diary.  Calvin:  Wow!  Deep in enemy territory, you intercepted a secret message?  What did it say??  Hobbes:  It said &quot;Calvin is a pig-faced smelly fat-head!&quot;  Calvin:  Then our club is a success!  Brilliant work, Hobbes!  Promotions for everyone!  Welcome back!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|9|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/09|https://assets.amuniversal.com/ddf91680df740131723d005056a9545d|632|900|Calvin:  Uh oh.  Here comes Susie.  Try not to breathe in.  Susie:  Here, Calvin.  Calvin:  What&#39;s this?  Susie:  It&#39;s an invitation. Mr. Bun is hosting a milk and cookie party in ten minutes, and you and Hobbes are invited.  Calvin:  We decline!  We wouldn&#39;t attend if you paid us!  We&#39;ve got better things to do than sit around with girls and dumb toy animals.  Susie:  Fine!  Don&#39;t come!  Who cares?!  What a jerk...I went to all this trouble, too.  Don&#39;t be disappointed, Mr. Bun.  We can have a nice party all by ourselves.  Phooey.  Calvin:  Ha! We showed her!  All girls should be shipped to Pluto - that&#39;s what I say.  Hobbes:  I wonder what kind of cookies they were.  Susie:  You came!  Calvin:  We don&#39;t attend parties.  We just crash &#39;em!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/405b1fc0decf013171ac005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  Help me with this homework, ok?  What&#39;s 6 + 3?  Hobbes:  6 +3, eh?  Well, this one is a bit tricky.  First we call the answer &quot;Y&quot;, as in &quot;Y do we care?&quot;  Now Y may be a square number, so we&#39;ll draw a square and make this side 6 and that side 3.  Then we&#39;ll measure the diagonal.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t remember the teacher explaining it like this.  Hobbes:  She probably doesn&#39;t know higher math.  When you deal with high numbers, you need higher math.  Calvin:  But this diagonal is just a little under two.  Hobbes:  Ok.  Here, I&#39;ll draw a bigger square.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/41a635b0decf013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Mom:  Hey, no comic books until you finish your homework.  Calvin:  I did finish.  Mom:  That didn&#39;t take very long.  Did you do a good job?  Calvin:  I did a great job.  When you&#39;re as far ahead of the class as I am, it doesn&#39;t take much time.  Mom:  Well we&#39;ll see about that when I get back from my parent-teacher conference with Miss Wormwood.  Calvin:  You&#39;re going to talk to my teacher?!  Mom:  I&#39;m sure it will be an informative meeting.  Calvin:  Gosh, I forgot to tell you!  Miss Wormwood said I was so good, you didn&#39;t need to bother coming.  Really!  She said you don&#39;t have to go!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4332b3e0decf013171ac005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  Oh man!  Mom went to a parent-teacher conference!  I&#39;m as good as dead!  Miss Wormwood will tell Mom all sorts of horror stories about me!  Hobbes:  Horror stories?  Calvin:  Well, it&#39;s all a question of perspective.  Still, I think I should be allowed to have a lawyer present at the meeting.  Hobbes:  What are you going to say when your mom gets back?  Calvin:  Nothing.  Hobbes:  Nothing at all?  Calvin:  Buddy, if you think I&#39;m even going to be here, you&#39;re crazy!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/447e2800decf013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Mom:  I&#39;m home.  Dad:  How was your meeting with Calvin&#39;s teacher?  Mom:  Well, when we got to the classroom, we saw that all the kids had drawn self-portraits in art class, and had left the pictures on their desks so the parents would recognize their child&#39;s seat.  Dad:  That&#39;s a cute idea.  Did you find Calvin&#39;s picture?  Mom:  There was one drawing of a green kid with fangs, six eyes, and his finger up his nose.  Dad:  Uh oh.  Mom:  The meeting went downhill from there.

Calvin:  Yike!!  You&#39;re home!  I didn&#39;t even finish pack.....that is, um...lies!  Everything Miss Wormwood said about me was a lie!  She just doesn&#39;t like me!  She hates little boys!  It&#39;s not my fault!  I&#39;m not to blame!  She told you about the noodles, right?  It wasn&#39;t me!  Nobody saw me!  I was framed!  I wouldn&#39;t do anything like that!  I&#39;m innocent, I tell you!  Mom:  What noodles?  Calvin:  Oh....uh....ha ha!  Did I say noodles?  You must have heard wrong.  I didn&#39;t say noodles.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|9|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/09/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4709ada0decf013171ac005056a9545d|288|900|Dad:  Ok Calvin, let&#39;s check over your math homework.  Calvin:  Let&#39;s not and say we did.  Dad:  Your teacher says you need to spend more time on it.  Have a seat.  Calvin:  More time?!  I already spent ten whole minutes on it!  Ten minutes shot!  Wasted!  Down the drain!  Dad:  You&#39;ve written here 8 + 4 = 7.  Now you know that&#39;s not right.  Calvin:  So I was off a little bit.  Sue me.  Dad:  You can&#39;t add things and come out with less than you started with!  Calvin:  I can do that!  It&#39;s a free country!  I&#39;ve got my rights!

Peanut butter!  Or so it seems. Did you see that?  Girl:  Hmm? What?  Calvin:  My sandwich wiggles!  There&#39;s something alive in it! Girl:  Oh, stop it, Calvin.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not kidding! Mom must be trying to kill me!  I bet there&#39;s a slug in my peanut butter!  Girl:  Eww!  Calvin: Hmm..I don&#39;t feel any slugs in here. What could it be?  I&#39;d better smell it.  Augh! Augh!  It&#39;s got my nose!!  The peanut butter itself is alive!  It&#39;s oozing up my face!  It&#39;s going to suck out my eyeballs!  Help! Rrgh!  Mmf! Blrghgh!  I got it off!  Quick!  Drown it in chocolate milk! Boy, what a close call that was!  Won&#39;t mom be disappointed to see her little plot failed!  Girl:  Look at you!  I&#39;ve never seen anything so revolting!  What&#39;s wrong with you?!  I&#39;m eating somewhere else.  Calvin:  Girls are so weird.

When you add something, you increase what you have.  You combine.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t want to learn this!  It&#39;s completely irrelevant to my life!  Dad:  This isn&#39;t irrelevant.  Everyone needs to know this.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t!  I can get along fine without math!  Dad:  Oh yeah?  What do you want to be when you grow up?  Every job requires some math.  Calvin:  That&#39;s not true!  I&#39;ll be a...a.....a caveman!  Yeah!  Dad:  That&#39;s not really a job.

I have eight pennies.  I ask you for four more.  Calvin:  I say forget it.  You&#39;re the one with a steady paycheck.  Dad:  Just give me the four pennies.  Good.  How much money do I have now?  Calvin:  Investments and all?  Dad:  No, just here on the table.  Calvin:  Eight cents.  Dad:  No, eight plus four is twelve.  See?  Count them up.  Calvin:  But those four are  mine!

Dad:  Pretty good.  I think Calvin sees the idea now.  I took pennies and showed how adding and subtracting them changed how much money he had.  It&#39;s not so abstract that way.  Mom:  Good.  Maybe he&#39;ll do better in class now.  Dad:  I think he will.  He was having fun with it by the end.  Calvin:  Now give me another five cents and let&#39;s see what I have!  Hobbes:  Wait a minute.

Calvin:  Ha!  Who needs your answers?!  I&#39;ll bet I get a better score than you do.  Susie Derkins:  you?!  That&#39;ll be the day!  Calvin:  I&#39;ll bet you 25 cents I get a higher grade.  Susie Derkins:  You&#39;re on.  Calvin:  You might as well give me the quarter now and save yourself the humiliation later!  Susie Derkins:  Maybe you&#39;d like to increase the wager, Mr. Bigmouth.  Calvin:  Yeah!  Let&#39;s double it and make it 35 cents!

Not only am I going to ace this quiz, but I&#39;m going to win a quarter from Susie when I get a better score than she does!  Ok!  The first problem is 6 + 5.  Oh, easy!  The answer is...um.....ummmmmmmm...  Calvin/Spaceman Spiff:  His spacecraft quietly humming, the incredible Spaceman Spiff approaches the sixth planet of the mysterio system!

At the controls, it&#39;s none other than our fearless hero, Spaceman Spiff!  Piloting over the lifeless world, he reflects on his unusual mission...

The anchor catches on a hillside!  Spiff downshifts and guns the motor!

I just did the first problem on this quiz!  Where did the time go??  Guess!  Guess!  Pick random numbers!  Maybe a few will be right by sheer luck!  15!  104!  3!  27!  Miss Wormwood:  Hand it in, Calvin.  Your time&#39;s up.  Susie Derkins:  Don&#39;t forget we have a bet on who gets the higher grade.  Calvin:  The bet&#39;s off!  I don&#39;t gamble!  No bets!

Calvin:  You got a perfect score??  Susie Derkins:  What did you get?  If you missed any, you owe me 25 cents.  Calvin:  I ran out of time!  I&#39;d have had a perfect score too if I&#39;d had a few more minutes!  Susie Derkins:  What did you get?  Calvin:  It&#39;s biological!  Girls mature faster than boys!  You just got a better grade because you&#39;re a girl!  It&#39;s not fair!  Susie Derkins:  Pay up.  Calvin:  Maybe it&#39;s opposite day!  Maybe all these X&#39;s mean my answers are correct!  Maybe your &quot;A&quot; is really an &quot;F&quot;!  That must be it!  I win the bet!

Calvin:  I flunked it...but only because I ran out of time.  The worst part though was that Susie Derkins won our bet on who&#39;d get the better score.  I had to pay her 25 cents.  But get this!  I cheated her!  I only gave her three dimes!  Ha!  Hobbes:  I think you&#39;d better study harder.  Calvin:  Oh, now don&#39;t you start on me.

Hobbes:  Heads.  Calvin:  You said &quot;tails&quot;, right?  Hobbes:  I said heads.  What a play!  I&#39;ll bet it takes you four downs just to get back on the field.  Calvin:  I think football  is a sport the way ducks think hunting is a sport.

See, I just hold it up and it&#39;s like I&#39;m on TV.  Hobbes: Wow, your own show!  Calvin: Too bad I can&#39;t really force my way into millions of people&#39;s homes each day.  But on the other hand, no one in this home can turn me off!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|10|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/10/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/58fd42a0decf013171ac005056a9545d|289|900|Hobbes:  So what&#39;s it like being on TV?  Calvin:  It&#39;s great!  now that I&#39;m on television, I&#39;m different from everybody else!  I&#39;m famous!  Important!  Since everyone knows me, everything I do now is newsworthy.  I&#39;m a cultural icon.  Hobbes:  I think your antenna needs adjusting.  Calvin:  Watch, I&#39;ll use my prestige to endorse a product!

I love &#39;em!  They&#39;re crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and they don&#39;t have a single natural ingredient or essential vitamin to get in the way of that rich, fudgy taste!  Mm-mm!  Yes kids, you&#39;ll like &#39;em so much, you won&#39;t be able to sit still!  Remember!  It&#39;s the cereal I get paid to recommend because I&#39;m famous!  What do you think?  Are you filled with the desire to emulate me and eat the cereal I endorse?  If not, I can repeat this every 20 minutes.  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t you threaten me.

He&#39;s the one who just can&#39;t be beat!  He&#39;s Ca-a-alvin!  La da ta da daaaaa!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Boy, what an audience!  Thank you!  Please!  Ha ha!  No, really, sit down!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Mom:  I&#39;m changing the channel, ok?  Calvin:  Sorry, I&#39;m on all the networks.

Calvin:  My fall lineup got canceled.  Dad said one TV in the house was bad enough, and he preferred the one with the volume control.  Hobbes:  Maybe you should go cable.  Calvin:  I&#39;ve got an idea for a sit-com called &quot;Father Knows Zilch&quot;.

They say if you connect these dots you get a picture, but look!  I did and it&#39;s just a big mess!  Hobbes:  I think you&#39;re supposed to connect them in the order that they&#39;re numbered.  Calvin:  Oh.  Everything&#39;s gotta have rules, rules, rules!

The fearless Spaceman Spiff sets off to expolre a new planet!  The fearless Spaceman Spiff sets off to explore a new planet!  The planet appears to be uninhabited.  The only sign of life is a strange lichen growning on the rocks.  Noticing the geometric patterns the lichen forms, Spiff bends down for a closer look.  It&#39;s not lichen!  It&#39;s tiny trees on tiny farmland! Peering ahead, our hero sees a sprawling city, with skyscrapers an inch high! The planet is inhabited after all!  Spiff reflects that human scale is by no means the standard for life forms.  As if to drive the point home, a blimp sized monster appears over the hillside!  Boy:  Hey, lookit Shorty here!  He&#39;s playing with his fellow bugs! Haw Haw! Calvin:  It&#39;s a Doofus Ignoramus! Our hero slowly reaches for his stun blaster!

Calvin:  It&#39;s clear I&#39;ll never have a career in sports until I learn to suppress my survival instinct.  Hobbes:  Touchdown!

Dad:  Well, your mom used to go to work, but once you came along, someone had to stay home.  You mom&#39;s job had a lot of stress and aggravation, see,...  Calvin:  ...And she wanted to quit?  Dad:  No, she&#39;d gotten used to it, so we figured she should be the one to...  Calvin:  Hey!

C&#39;mon Hobbes, I&#39;ve decided to be a wildlife painter!  We&#39;ll go outside and you can pose for me.  Hobbes:  Oh boy!  I get to be in a painting!  Calvin:  This looks like a good natural environment. Sit on that big rock.  Hobbes:  Van Gogh would&#39;ve sold more than one painting if he&#39;d put tigers in them.  Calvin:  Ok, you&#39;re lord of the wilderness!  From your perch your survey your territory with the quiet confidence and steely eye of a jungle cat!  Hobbes:  Like this?  Calvin:  No, that&#39;s not quite it.  Hobbes:  This?  Calvin:  Too formal. Let&#39;s try one where the fierce tiger rests in the shade after a kill.  Hobbes:  How&#39;s this?  Calvin:  No, no.  Hobbes:  How?  Calvin:  This isn&#39;t working at all.  Hobbes:  How about this?  Calvin:  Yes! That&#39;s it!  Hold that!  Boy, I had no idea this would be so hard.  Can you imagine posing a dumb moose?  Hobbes:  Notice I&#39;m more of a yellow ochre than a straight orange.

Somebody&#39;s always running my life. I never get to do what I want to do.  Hobbes: What would you do if you could stay up?  Calvin: I dunno...something fun! Whatever mom and dad get to do!

Our Solar System in on the edge of it.  We hurl through an incoprehensible darkness.  In cosmic terms, we are subatomic particles in a grain of sand on an infinite beach.  I wonder what&#39;s on TV now.

Nobody pays any attention to my needs!  Is it too much to ask for an occasional token gesture of appreciation?!  Mom:  Ok, how about a big hug?  Calvin:  Could I have 20 dollars?  See?!  I don&#39;t matter to anyone!  Nobody cares about me!

Hobbes:  I think our actions show what&#39;s in our hearts.  Calvin:  I resent that!

I refuse to compromise my principles!  I don&#39;t need to compromise my principles, because they don&#39;t have the slightest bearing on what happens to me anyway.

Miss Wormwood:  Your book ate your homework, hmm?  That&#39;s a new one.  Calvin:  I&#39;m lucky to be alive!  I had to break it&#39;s spine!

Mom:  Are you getting ready for Halloween?  Calvin:  Huh?  No, this is for every day.  You know how Hobbes always sneaks up from behind and pounces on me?  Mom:  No...  Calvin:  Well, he does.  But if you wear a mask like this on the back of your head, tigers can&#39;t tell which way you&#39;re facing, and they can&#39;t sneak up.  Mom:  I think you train of thought is a runaway.  Calvin:  I read they wear these in India.  Here, I made a mask for you too.

I made you a mask like mine.  You wear it on the back of your head to prevent tiger attacks.  Dad:  Um...  Calvin:  Tigers always try to get you from behind, but with this mask on, they can&#39;t tell which way you&#39;re facing, so they don&#39;t pounce.  I read it in a book.  Dad:  Well, I appreciate your concern, but I think I&#39;ll take my chances and not look like a lunatic.  Calvin:  Ok, if you&#39;d rather look like raw hamburgur, be my guest.  Dad:  Honey, are we out of aspirin again?

I guess you won&#39;t be pouncing on me anymore!  See, I&#39;m wearing a mask on the back of my head!  Now you can&#39;t tell which way I&#39;m facing, so you can&#39;t sneak up from behind!  I&#39;ve finally thwarted your murderous recreation!  Maybe this will teach you that people are smarter than animals!  You can&#39;t outwit a human!  Ho fair!  You didn&#39;t even sneak up!

Calvin:  Just when I thought this junk was beginning to make sense.

I can&#39;t believe how smart I am.  I&#39;ve got more brains than I know what to do with.  Hobbes:  So I&#39;ve noticed.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|10|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/10/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f7558b20df740131723d005056a9545d|630|900|Calvin:  First down and one yard to go.  Hobbes:  Only one yard?  Calvin:  Yeah, the neighbors won&#39;t let us play in their yard. Hobbes:  Hike!  Go out long!  Fumble!  Oops.  Whose team was I on when I recovered the ball?  Calvin:  It doesn&#39;t matter.  The game&#39;s called on account of sudden death.

Smart move, sissy boy.  Calvin:  In my opinion, we don&#39;t devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks.

Mmf!  Rrg!  Stop thrashing!...I&#39;ve almost got it...almost...mmf!  There!  Boy, it&#39;s a good thing you had this removed!  Just look at all these bad spots!  Susie:  Lunch shouldn&#39;t have to be like this.

Wouldn&#39;t you say this is a great drawing?  I mean, can you believe my teacher didn&#39;t like it?!  She said it wasn&#39;t &quot;serious&quot;!  By golly, if this isn&#39;t serious art, then nothing is!  Who set Miss Wormwood up as an arbiter of aesthetics anyway?  This is a beautiful work of power and depth!  Hobbes:  It&#39;s a stegosaurus in a rocket ship, right?  Calvin:  See?  You understood it!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|11|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/11/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7a37b170decf013171ac005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  On the one hand, it&#39;s a good sign for us artists that, in this age of visual bombardment from all media, a simple drawing can provoke and shock viewers.  It confirms that images still have power.  On the other hand, my teacher&#39;s reactionary grading shows that our society is culturally illiterate and that many people can&#39;t tell good art from a hole in the ground.  This drawing I did obviously challenges the know-nothing complacency of those who prefer safe, predigested, bucolic genre scenes.  My &quot;C-&quot; firmly establishes me on the cutting edge of the avantgarde.  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t you have to wear silly clothes then?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|11|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/11/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7b6ec430decf013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  The hard part for us avant-garde post-modern artists is deciding whether or not to embrace commercialism.  Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market that&#39;s simply hungry for the next new thing?  Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so it&#39;s better suited for mass consumption?  Of course, when an artist goes commercial, he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker.  He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend.  He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame.  Oh, what the heck.  I&#39;ll do it.  Hobbes:  That wasn&#39;t so hard.

The arts are under attack!  Freedom of expression is being squelched!  The authorities are trying to silence any view contrary to their own!  Hobbes:  What does your teacher object to about dinosaurs?  Calvin:  Mostly my drawing them during math.

What a waste to be going to school on a morning like this.  Hobbes:  What would you do if you could stay home this morning?  Calvin:  Sleep right through it.

I don&#39;t want to hear any disgusting comments about lunch.  Calvin:  Relax.  I won&#39;t talk about lunch at all.  Instead, do you want to hear a riddle I made up?  Susie:  A riddle?  OK.  Calvin:  What&#39;s the difference between a garden slug and a two-inch-long, living booger?  Susie:  Eww!!  Calvin:  I can&#39;t think of a difference either.

Calvin:  Forget it, Moe.  Wait your turn.  It&#39;s hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning.

Geysers of molten lava spray into the heavens!

Calvin:  No, he isn&#39;t.  Phone:  OK, will you write down my number and have him call me?  Calvin:  Hold on.  I need a pen.  Aghh!  I&#39;ve been shot!  I hate taking messages.

It&#39;s a school project.  Mom:  I think so.  Let&#39;s see.  Here&#39;s one.  What are you going to do with it?  Calvin:  I&#39;m supposed to make a diorama.  We&#39;re studying the different eco-systems and I&#39;m going to make a desert scene.  Mom:  That sounds interesting.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll need some glue and paper and stuff too.  I&#39;m going to build a cactus and a roadrunner.  Mom:  When is this due?  Calvin:  It was due today, but I told the teacher I wasn&#39;t quite finished.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|11|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/11/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8803dc20decf013171ac005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin:  Wow, mom sure turned into the conniption queen when she found out I hadn&#39;t even started my diorama project when it was already due today.  So this is one day late!  What&#39;s the big deal?!  It&#39;s not as if lives hang in the balance, right?  The fate of the universe doesn&#39;t depend on turning in a shoe box desert scene on time!  Hobbes:  That&#39;s keeping things in perspective.  Calvin:  Even if lives did hang in the balance, it would depend on whose they were.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|11|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/11/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8947ba50decf013171ac005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  This is hopeless!  How am I supposed to create a desert scene in this shoe box when I don&#39;t even know what a desert looks like?!  I&#39;ve never been to a desert!  Mom and dad never take me anywhere fun on vacations!  If they&#39;d taken my to a desert sometime, I&#39;d know this stuff!  Hobbes:  Why don&#39;t you get out a book?  Calvin:  And go to all that trouble?!  Yeah, sure!  Look, I&#39;m a busy guy!  I&#39;ve got other things to do with my life besides this, you know!  Hobbes:  Right.  Why waste time learning, when ignorance is instantaneous?  Calvin:  My TV show starts in 20 minutes.  Are you going to help me or not?

Mom:  We don&#39;t have any.  Calvin:  Oh great!  Just great!  How am I going to make a roadrunner without papier-mache?!  Mom:  Maybe you should&#39;ve thought of that before 7:00 at night, you&#39;ll have to make one some other way.  Calvin:  But how?!  Mom:  This is your school project, Calvin.  You do the work.  Calvin:  If I get a bad grade, It&#39;ll be your fault for not doing the work for me!

Calvin:  I&#39;m almost finished.  Hobbes:  That didn&#39;t take too long.  Calvin:  That&#39;s because I&#39;m a genius.  Hobbes:  I don&#39;t see the roadrunner.  Weren&#39;t you going to put one in?  Calvin:  See the cotton balls I glued down?  Hobbes:  Yeah?  Calvin:  The roadrunner just ran out of the scene, leaving those clouds of dust!

All right, what&#39;s wrong with you?  Like I care.  Susie as patient: My foot hurts doctor.  Calvin:  Your foot hurts?  What kind of stupid problem is that??! Susie:  You&#39;re the doctor!  You&#39;re supposed to find out what&#39;s wrong with it.  Doctor:  It&#39;s psychosomatic. You need a lobotomy.  I&#39;ll get a saw.  Susie:  A lobotomy?! That&#39;s not what a real doctor would say.  Calvin:  Yeah?  Who&#39;s wearing the stethoscope, you or me?  Here&#39;s a mallet, do you want anesthesia?  Susie:  Wh-That&#39;s to test reflexes!  Y-You don&#39;t know anything! Calvin:  How about a shot then?  Like a shot in the mouth!  Susie:  That does it! I know more about medicine than you!! I&#39;ll be the doctor now!  Calvin:  Ow! Ow! Quit kicking!  See, that&#39;s why your dumb foot hurts!  Stop it!  Susie:  Say it! Say I&#39;m the doctor!  Calvin:  Ok, you&#39;re the doctor!  But I&#39;m not going to be any patient of yours!  I&#39;m leaving!  Susie:  Fine! Good riddance!  You ruin everything!  Calvin:  The surgeon general should issue a warning about playing with girls.  Calvin:  I&#39;d be Susie&#39;s patient!

You have no responsibilities at all!  It must be nice!  Wipe that insolent smirk off your face!  Hobbes:  The real fun of living wisely is that you get to be smug about it.

It&#39;s too much work!  Why should I bother?  Hobbes:  &quot;Until you stalk and overrun, you can&#39;t devour anyone.&quot;  Calvin:  I can see why tiger aphorisms don&#39;t catch on.

You never know how long you&#39;ve got!  You could step into the road tomorro and - wham - you get hit by a cement truck!  Then you&#39;d be sorry you put off your pleasures!  That&#39;s why I say &quot;live for the moment&quot;.  What&#39;s your motto?  Hobbes:  &quot;Look down the road.&quot;

I mean, in heaven, everyone is supposed to be happy, right?  But people wouldn&#39;t be happy if they were always in danger of being eaten by tigers!  On the other hand, heaven wouldn&#39;t be very nice without tigers, either.  I wouldn&#39;t be happy if there weren&#39;t any tigers.  I&#39;d miss them.  Maybe tigers just don&#39;t eat people in heaven.  Hobbes:  But then we wouldn&#39;t be happy.

Come get it!  Calvin:  Oh sure!  You just want me to come down three so you can grab me with some oozing appendage, slowly paralyze me with some vile secretion, and devour me alive!  Nice try!  Forget it! Stupid monsters.  Al gangs and no brains.  Voice:  Psst! Tiger! We&#39;ll give you some salmon if you push the kid over the bed!  Hobbes:  Is the salmon fresh?  Voice:  Hold on.  I&#39;ll check. Yeah, it&#39;s fresh.  Calvin:  Hobbes, don&#39;t listen to them!!

Go ahead, pick a number!  Dad:  Mm...ok, I&#39;ve got it.  Calvin:  Is it 92,376,051?  Dad:  By golly, it is!  Calvin:  Wait a minute!  You&#39;re just trying to get rid of me, aren&#39;t you?!

Well, by lunch time, the jelly had soaked into the bread.  That grosses me out.  So tomorrow, I&#39;d like the jelly put in a separate container with a knife, so I can spread the jelly at the last possible moment before I eat the sandwich.  Also, you keep using bread from the middle of the loaf.  I only like those pieces for toast.  For sandwiches, I want only the end pieces, because those don&#39;t absorb as much jelly, got it?

You made your bed without even being told to!  That&#39;s wonderful, Calvin!  Hobbes:  Gee, your mom sure is nice when you help her.  Calvin:  Yeah.  That&#39;s the reason I usually don&#39;t.  I like mom to be impressed when I fulfill the least of my obligations.

It&#39;s snowing! There must be almost half an inch! By morning, I&#39;l bet the&#39;s TONS of snow! Do yo think the schools will close?? What? Oh YEAH? WELL, SAME TO YOU!! I wonder how a crabby guy like him got to be superintendent.

Hobbes:  I&#39;ll say.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ve never seen a sled catch fire before.  Calvin:  We&#39;re lucky the pond hadn&#39;t frozen.

Pitiful. Just pitiful.  Here comes Susie. Ooh, if only I had a snowball. I&#39;d smack it right across the back of her fat head!  Hobbes: I&#39;ll bet Santa Claus heard that!  Calvin: Oh, man, I forgot! I hate this time of year.  Hobbes: You&#39;d better say you&#39;re sorry.  Calvin: I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean it!  Hobbes: You&#39;d better say you like Susie.  Calvin: What?! Never! That&#39;s going too darn far!  Hobbes: You&#39;d better say you&#39;d like to give her muchas smoochies!  Calvin: Muchas smoochies?!  Susie: Hi Calvin. What are you doing.  Calvin:  Fighting. Go away.  Susie: I don&#39;t know what&#39;s weirder - that you&#39;re fighting a stuffed animal, or that you seem to be losing.  Calvin: I&#39;m not losing! Hobbes cheats! Quit it, you! Ow! Stop it!  Hobbes: After today, I&#39;ll bet Santa takes a shovel to the reindeer stalls to fill your stocking.  Calvin: You&#39;re no better off than I am, buddy.

Get your ice-cold lemonade!  Just five dollars a glass, while it lasts!  Hobbes:  How are sales?  Calvin:  Terrible.  I don&#39;t understand it.  Hobbes:  It sure is cold out.  Calvin:  Yep.  See, my lemonade has &quot;all-natural&quot; refrigeration!  Want to buy a glass?  Hobbes:  Sorry.  All my savings are in bonds.  Calvin:  Maybe I should start charging ten dollars so I don&#39;t have to sell as much.

I&#39;m going to be the richest man alive!  But I won&#39;t let wealth change me!  Dad:  Rats.  That was our last hope.  Calvin:  You&#39;re going to be pretty lonely in the nursing home.  Dad:  Maybe then I can finish this book.

Hobbes:  Sure!  Calvin:  What do you get when you cross a cantaloupe with Lassie?  Hobbes:  I give up.  Calvin:  A melon-collie baby!  Get it??  Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh!  Oh!  Haa ha ha!  He just doesn&#39;t want to face up to the fact that I&#39;ll be the life of every party.

I can&#39;t find them anywhere.  Mom:  I haven&#39;t seen them.  Calvin:  Calvin, go do something you hate!  Being miserable builds character!  Dad:  Ok, the voice was a little funny, but that&#39;s still one darn sarcastic kid we&#39;re raising.

That was very good.  All right, who&#39;d like to go next?  Anyone at all, besides Calvin.  Calvin: Hey! For show and tell, I brought these amazing fossilized bone fragments that I painstakingly unearthed from sedimentary deposits in my front yard!  Though they look like ordinary driveway gravel to the untutored eye of the ignorant layman, I immediately recognized these as pieces of jawbone from a new species of carnosaur!  In this dramatic illustration, I&#39;ve re-created the complete  Calvinosaurus as it would have appeared in the late Jurassic!  Its coloration here is somewhat conjectural.  I&#39;ll be publishing my full findings shortly!  Undoubtedly, I&#39;ll be the recipient of many lucrative paleontology prizes and in a matter of weeks, prestige, fame and fortune will be mine. When this happens, you can be darn sure that those of you who were mean to me in school will suffer appropriately!  I&#39;ll employ my resources to make your puny lives miserable!  I&#39;ll crush your pitiful dreams and ambitions like bugs in the dust!  But there is an alternative!  I&#39;m now accepting a limited number of applications to be my pal.  The cost is just $20 per person, and you can revel in the association for a lifetime! Any takers?  Oh yeah?  You just wait!

Calvin:  Yep.  Dad:  Another show extolling love and peace interrupted every seven minutes by commercials extolling greed and waste.  I hate to think what you&#39;re learning from this.  Calvin:  I&#39;m learning I need my own TV so I can watch someplace else.

Should I add anything for you?  Hobbes:  Hmm...I can&#39;t think of anything.  Calvin:  Nothing?!  You don&#39;t want anything at all?!?  Hobbes:  I&#39;ve got a good home and a best friend.  What more could a tiger want?  Calvin:  It must be sad being a species with so little imagination.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/a6f7d050decf013171ac005056a9545d|283|900|Calvin:  Thanks for helping me mail my letter to Santa.  Hobbes:  It sure was heavy.  Calvin:  Those big envelopes only had a couple hundred pages.  That&#39;s why I used a box.  Hobbes:  I hope Santa doesn&#39;t throw his back out when he gets it.  Calvin:  All I can say is, this year Santa had better bring everything on my list!  I&#39;ve been extremely good all year!  Hobbes:  What about the noodle incident?  Calvin:  No one can prove I did that!!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/a83ff800decf013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  This whole business of Santa rewarding good kids and neglecting bad kids really bugs me. ...Not that I have anything to worry about, of course.  Hobbes:  A paragon of virtue, that&#39;s you.  Calvin:  Right!  But see, there are certain things a good kid could do that might look bad in a certain light, if one didn&#39;t consider all the mitigating circumstances.  Hobbes:  Like keeping incontinent toad in your mom&#39;s sweater drawer?  Calvin:  Exactly.  If I was being raised in a better enviroment, I wouldn&#39;t do things like that.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/a9839a50decf013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  I think if Santa is going to judge my behavior over the last year, I ought to be entitled to legal representation.  I mean, let&#39;s face it, a lot of Christmas loot is at stake here, and the constitution says no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law.  So you can be my lawyer, ok?  It&#39;s easy!  Hobbes:  Me??  Calvin:  Sure!  Here&#39;s a legal pad!  You&#39;re all set!  Hobbes:  Ok, but I don&#39;t take pro bono cases.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/aac4d1b0decf013171ac005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin:  Ok, Hobbes, as my lawyer, you&#39;ll need to review the facts of my case.  Hobbes:  Right.  We&#39;ll try to establish that you were insane at the time of the alleged crimes.  Calvin:  We&#39;re not copping an insanity plea, you moron!  We&#39;re saying I&#39;m innocent!  Hobbes:  Insulting an attorney is a penal offense, so watch it, buster.  Calvin:  You&#39;re supposed to argue that I haven&#39;t been bad this year, and I deserve to be on Santa&#39;s &quot;good&quot; list!  Hobbes:  If that&#39;s our case, I advise you to settle out of court.  Calvin:  In a minute, you and I are going to settle this out of doors.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/0e536710df750131723d005056a9545d|630|900|Calvin: There. Now we need to get this on the roof.  I&#39;ve been thinking. They say Santa knows if you&#39;ve been bad or good, right? Hobbes: Right. Calvin: But think how many kids there are in the whole world!  Nobody could be watching every kid every single minute!  I mean, Santa&#39;s old! He probably takes naps!  The way I figure it, Santa must just make a few random checks on us once or twice a week.  Hobbes: That&#39;s all?  Calvin: Sure. He&#39;d catch enough bad kids that way to scare everyone else into being good most of the time.  He&#39;d create the impression that he&#39;s watching more than he really is!  Hobbes: Pretty shrewd.  Calvin: Yeah, but now that I&#39;m on to him, I&#39;m going to go smack Susie with a snowball! If I do it quick, the odds of Santa watching me at that exact moment are virtually nil!  Hobbes: What if Susie tells on you?  Calvin: Ooh, I didn&#39;t think of that! She&#39;s a girl, so she probably would snitch.  Phooey.  Well I sure hop Santa&#39;s watching now, seeing as I&#39;m being so good.  Hobbes: Unwillingly good, but good nonetheless.

Hobbes and I are off to the North Pole!  Mom:  The North Pole?  Calvin:  Yep!  We&#39;re going to see Santa.  Mom:  How come?  You already sent him your Christmas list.  Calvin:  Yeah, but I&#39;m afraid Santa might not have considered my version of certain recent events.  Hobbes is going to be my lawyer and present my case.  Mom:  Just how recent are these recent events you&#39;re talking about?  Calvin:  Gotta go, mom.  It&#39;s a long walk.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/ad48b930decf013171ac005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  Ok, here&#39;s our strategy: when we get to the North Pole, we tell Santa that I&#39;ve been the victim of malicious slanders by my enemies, and we&#39;re appealing to him for justice.  We say that I&#39;m really a good kid...a good kid with a good heart!  We say I&#39;m good, good, good from the moment I get up until...Hey!  There&#39;s Susie!  Hobbes:  ...Until the moment a thought enters your head.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t think she saw us!  Quick, pack some slushballs!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/aed68310decf013171ac005056a9545d|283|900|Calvin:  Susie&#39;s still concentrating on her snowman!  Let&#39;s sneak up and barrage her with slushballs!  Hobbes:  Two minutes ago we were on our way to tell Santa how good you are, remember?  Have you lost your marbles?!  Calvin:  Oops.  I forgot.  How many presents do you think I&#39;d forfeit for just one clean smack upside Susie&#39;s head?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/b05f1450decf013171ac005056a9545d|287|900|Hobbes:  Look, I&#39;m not going to be your lawyer if you can&#39;t even walk a block without pasting someone with a slushball!  Calvin:  Its not just &quot;someone&quot;!  It&#39;s Susie!  It&#39;s a girl!  Santa would understand!  He would so!  What?  Oh yeah?  I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m going to hit Susie with a big, icy slushball!  Oh really?  Well, maybe that furry mug of yours needs a slushball, too!  Yeah, you heard me!  Ow!  No biting!  Shh!  Shh!  Hold it!...Did you just hear a snicker?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/b1cd8ca0decf013171ac005056a9545d|288|900|Susie:  Plotting to hit me with a slushball, eh?  Well, here!  Calvin:  See that?  See that?!  She hit me first!  Now if I hit her, it&#39;s justified!  Ha ha ha!  Sweet revenge!  Oh boy!  Oh boy!  Hobbes: ...Or you could prove to Santa how good you are.  It&#39;s your big chance...  Calvin:  I don&#39;t want to be this good!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/b3498820decf013171ac005056a9545d|284|900|Mom:  Back from the North Pole already?  Calvin:  No, we didn&#39;t even get past Susie&#39;s house.  Calvin:  But mom, I proved how good I am!  Susie hit me with a snowball and I didn&#39;t even get her back!  Santa has got to give me lots of presents now!  Mom:  Why did Susie hit you with a snowball?  Calvin:  She overheard us plotting to...I mean, um, we were just minding our business when suddenly for no reason, Susie...  Hobbes:  Ok, you lied.  Do something good fast, and maybe this last hour will sort of even out to neutral.  Calvin:  Three more days!  I&#39;ll never make it three more days!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/119c2490df750131723d005056a9545d|633|900|Calvin: and Santa, if I get any lords-a-leaping or geese a-laying, you&#39;ve had it!  Hmmm..that might not be politic.  I&#39;m getting nervous about Christmas.  Hobbes: You&#39;re worried you haven&#39;t been good?  Calvin: That&#39;s just the question. It&#39;s all relative. What&#39;s Santa&#39;s definition?  How good do you have to be to qualify as good?  I haven&#39;t killed anybody. See, that&#39;s good, right? I haven&#39;t committed any felonies. I didn&#39;t start any wars. I don&#39;t practice cannibalism.  Wouldn&#39;t you say that&#39;s pretty good?  Wouldn&#39;t you say I should get lots of presents? Hobbes: But maybe good is more than the absence of bad.  Calvin: See, that&#39;s what worries me... OK, assuming I can get an overnight letter to the North Pole, what would you charge to write me a glowing character reference?  Hobbes: Oh no, I&#39;m not going to perjure myself for you! My record&#39;s clean!

The presents are wrapped and sent, and Calvin&#39;s in bed.  For the first time this month, there&#39;s nothing that has to be done.  Dad:  I know...sometimes this season really seems out of control.  We don&#39;t often think about what it&#39;s all supposed to mean.  Mom:  Mm-hmm.  It&#39;s good to sit by a cozy fire and take some quiet time to reflect.  Calvin:  What&#39;s this?!  Santa flambe??

Wake up!  Merry Christmas, ol&#39; buddy!  Hobbes:  Merry Christmas.  Calvin:  I didn&#39;t get you a present, but you&#39;re my best friend in the world, Hobbes.  Hobbes:  You&#39;re my best friend, too.  I think that&#39;s a great gift.  Calvin:  Well, enough of that!  It&#39;s almost 4 am!  Let&#39;s wake mom and dad and see what Santa brought us!  Hobbes:  Remember we agreed that if Santa gave you any salmon, you&#39;d share it!

Hobbes:  This is prompt.  Calvin:  Oh yeah.  I always send grandma a thank-you note right away. ...Ever since she sent me that empty box with the sarcastic note saying she was just checking to see if the postal service was still working.

No one dares attack me!  Everybody is too chicken!  I&#39;m outside my fort now!

I can almost see my breath!  Dad:  The thermostat is at 68 degrees, where it&#39;s going to stay.  Calvin:  I&#39;m surprised the water pipes haven&#39;t frozen!  Look, my lips are blue!  I&#39;m catching pneumonia!  I&#39;m going into hypothermia!  Dad:  If you&#39;re cold, why don&#39;t you go shovel the driveway and get your blood moving.  Nice sweater.  Calvin:  Hmph.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1990|12|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/12/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/14d4c850df750131723d005056a9545d|636|900|Calvin: I asked Dad if he wanted to see some new year&#39;s resolutions I wrote. He said he&#39;d be glad to, and he was pleased to see I was taking an interest in self-improvement.  I told him the resolutions weren&#39;t for me, they were for him.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re outside now.  Hobbes: I wondered what the rush was.  Calvin: I&#39;m getting disillusioned with these new years.  They don&#39;t seem very new at all! Each new year is just like the old year!  Here another year has gone by and everything&#39;s still the same!  There&#39;s still pollution and war and stupidity and greed!  Things haven&#39;t changed!  I say what kind of future is this?!  I thought things were supposed to improve!  I thought the future was supposed to be better!  Hobbes: The problem with the future is that it keeps turning into the present.

Live!  Live!  Livvve!  Snowman:  Rrghh!

I thought you were out building a snowman.  Calvin:  I did (pant, pant), but I brought him to life (pant, pant) and now he&#39;s after me!  I barely escaped!  Mom:  Uh huh.  Calvin:  Look out the window!  He&#39;s probably lurching around the yard!  Mom:  Good heavens, you built a snowman right on the front step?!  How are we going to get out the door?!  Calvin:  Aughh!  He&#39;s looking in!  He knows where I live!!

Calvin:  I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be evil!  Hobbes:  What are we going to do?  Calvin:  I dunno, but we&#39;ve got to get rid of him somehow.  Hobbes:  Maybe we could lure him inside and he&#39;d melt!  Calvin:  It would take hours, and if he didn&#39;t kill Mom, she&#39;d have a fit about the water on the floor.  Hobbes:  Hmm...how did they finally kill &quot;Frosty&quot;?  Calvin:  Beats me.  Now I wish I&#39;d watched that dumb show!  Maybe they stabbed him with an icicle.

There he is!  Calvin:  Pack snowballs!  Maybe we can knock him out!  Yaa!  Yaa!  Snowman:  Unghh!  Hobbes:  The snowballs just stuck to him!  Calvin:  Look, it&#39;s given him an idea!  Hobbes:  He&#39;s packing more snow onto himself!  Calvin:  He&#39;s making himself bigger!  Oh no!

He&#39;s getting huge!  Hobbes:  This is really creepy.  Calvin:  Now he&#39;s made a big snowball and he&#39;s putting rocks and sticks on it!  I wonder what he&#39;s making.  Ewww!  He&#39;s giving himself two wierd heads!!  Hobbes:  Any time the sun wanted to come out, it would be just fine with me.  Calvin:  Now he&#39;s added another arm!  He&#39;s turned himself into a deranged mutant killer monster snow goon!!

Calvin:  Let&#39;s cut around the house and build a fort!  Hobbes:  What do you suppose it&#39;s going to do?  Calvin:  I don&#39;t know, but whatever it is, we&#39;re going to need protection!  Dad:  Calvin, that snowman out front is hideous.  Why can&#39;t you make a normal snowman?  Calvin:  I tried, Dad.  I tried.

Snowman 1:  Ughh  Ngghh  rghh  mnhg  Snowman 2:  Unnhh  Calvin:  There!  We&#39;re safe from that snow goon now!  Hobbes:  I wonder why we haven&#39;t seen him for a while.

Nice snow fort.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll say!  The walls are two feet thick and we&#39;ve got 50 snowballs in here!  Susie Derkins:  Who are you fighting?  Calvin:  There&#39;s a snow goon running loose!  If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t stick around.  This could get ugly.  Susie Derkins:  What&#39;s a snow goon?  Calvin:  It&#39;s like a snow man, but a grotesque, evil, demented monster.  Susie Derkins:  Oh, is that what all those ugly things you made in the front yard are?  Calvin:  What do you mean, &quot;all those&quot;?

A new snow goon!  Calvin:  That&#39;s not the one I made!  The original snow goon must be making his own snow goons!  Hobbes:  Oh no!  Calvin:  I&#39;ll bet he&#39;s making an army!  In a few days, he could build a hundred snow goons!  If each of them built another hundred, and then those all built a hundred more, why...  ...That would be pretty cool, if they weren&#39;t out to kill me.  Hobbes:  I vote we make tracks for Florida.

Time to come in!  Calvin:  I can&#39;t, Mom!  I&#39;ve got to kill snow goons!  Mom:  You can kill them tomorrow after school.  C&#39;mon inside.  Calvin:  But by tomorrow, there will be more of them!  Mom:  Let&#39;s go, Calvin.  Calvin:  Moms and reason are like oil and water.

Hobbes:  Yeah.  They&#39;re still making more of each other.  Calvin:  How many did you see?  Hobbes:  About 15.  Calvin:  Man, how am I going to go to school tomorrow?  I&#39;ll never even make it to the bus stop!  I can&#39;t outrun 15 snow goons!  I&#39;m as good as dead!  Mom:  Sweet dreams.  Calvin:  Yeah, right!  Can I take an ax to school tomorrow for...um...Show and Tell?

They&#39;re asleep!  Now&#39;s our chance to go bump &#39;em off!  Hobbes:  We can&#39;t go outside now!  It&#39;s 10 o&#39;clock at night!  Calvin:  Oh yeah.  Mom and Dad are still up.  Hobbes:  We&#39;ll have to wait at least an hour.

It&#39;s bedtime.  Hobbes:  Ooh, I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to sleep through that. Calvin:  I wonder why we dream when we sleep.  Do our brains get bored?  I wonder why we don&#39;t just plain sleep.  Hobbes:  I think we dream so we don&#39;t have to be apart so long.  If we&#39;re in each other&#39;s dreams, we can play together all night.  Calvin:  Hey, yeah!  Well, I&#39;ll se you in a few minutes, ol&#39; buddy!  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll be there!

We&#39;ll freeze the snow goons right where they snooze!  Die!  Die!  Let out more hose!  Ha ha!  These monsters will be popsicles through July!  There!  We got &#39;em all!  I&#39;ll spray a little extra water around, just to make sure everything&#39;s absolutely frozen.  Hobbes:  Psst, Calvin!  Your parents&#39; light is on!  I think you dad&#39;s coming!  Calvin:  Uh oh!  Maybe I should get him with the hose, too.

He&#39;s outside with the garden hose!  Dad:  It&#39;s after midnight!  What do we have to do, chain him in the bed?!  Calvin get in here!  What do you think you&#39;re...  Waaughh!  The wholw yard&#39;s ice!  Calvin:  Run, Hobbes!  Dad&#39;s a snow goon too!

I can explain this!  Help!  Help!  Snow goons!  I froze &#39;em!  They were going to get me, so I had to get them first!  Ask Hobbes!  Dad:  Calvin, it is after midnight.  Believe me, we will discuss this very thoroughly tomorrow.  You get into bed this instant.  Calvin:  Like I&#39;m going to get any sleep now.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|1|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/01/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d9f633e0df7c01317244005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  See??  See the snow goons?  I didn&#39;t make them!  I mean, I made one, sort of by accident, but the rest made themselves!  They were building an army, see?  See, that&#39;s why I had to freeze them last night!  I had to get &#39;em while they were sleeping!  It was my only chance, see?  See, it all makes sense!  See?  See??  They never see.

Hobbes:  What&#39;s that?  Calvin:  &quot;Snow goons are bad news.&quot;  Hobbes:  That lesson certainly ought to be inapplicable elsewhere in life.  Calvin:  I like maxims that don&#39;t encourage behavior modification.

His stabilizers useless, his fuel about to explode, our hero careens out of control over a strange, unexplored planet!  Yes, it&#39;s just another typical day for the incredible Spaceman Spiff!Zorched by Zarches, Spaceman Spiff&#39;s crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg! Dazed but undauted, our fearless hero sets off in search of a service station!  Zounds!  The zealous Zarches have followed Spiff to the planets surface to finish him off!  With a sudden chill, our hero realizes the planet&#39;s soft granular ground makes him easy to track! Thinking quickly, Spiff runs backward, so hi s tracks show him going the opposite direction!  By continuing past a hiding place and doubling back, our hero fools the hideous aliens!  Mom:  Calvin!  It&#39;s time to come in!  Dad:  We know he went this way. We&#39;ll find him.

On the other hand, if we miss, we&#39;ll probably spend our remaining few days hooked up to machines and intravenous fluids!  It&#39;s either spectacular, unbelievable success, or crushing, hopeless defeat!  There is no middle ground!  Ok, there is a middle ground, but it&#39;s for sissy weasels.

Here we are, perched at the peak of Mount Mum!  Why?  Because I like to experience life to the fullest!  I say you don&#39;t fully appreciate life until you risk losing it!  I like to stare death straight in the eye and make him blink!  If your adrenalin isn&#39;t pumping, you&#39;re not really living! Right?  Hobbes:  Actually, I think real living is sitting by a fire, slurping marshmallows from the bottom of a mug of hot cocoa.

Calvin, how about you?  Calvin:  Sorry!  I&#39;m here against my will.  I refuse to cooperate.  They can transport my body to school, but they can&#39;t chain my spirit!  My spirit roams free!  Walls can&#39;t confine it!  Laws can&#39;t restrain it!  Authority has no power over it!  Miss Wormwood:  Calvin, if you&#39;d put half the energy of your protests into your schoolwork...

Calvin:  you can put my body to bed, but my spirit&#39;s going to stay right here, so why bother?  Why shouldn&#39;t I just stay up?  Dad:  Because the body is the home of the spirit, and if you&#39;re not in bed in two minutes, your spirit is going to be permanently nomadic.  Calvin:  Home sweet home.

Of course, I don&#39;t think there should be school in the Fall either...and Summer&#39;s out already...and then there&#39;s Spring...I guess I&#39;d go t school a day in November and a day in March. Hobbes: By second grade, you&#39;d be packing your lunch box with denture cleaners.  Calvin: And before I got to third grade, I could retire.

Have the photoreceptors in Calvin&#39;s eyes stopped working properly, or has the fundamental nature of light changed??  Perhaps some strange nuclear or chemical reaction on the sun has caused electromagnetic radiation to defy separation into a spectrum?  Maybe objects no longer reflect certain wavelengths!  What ever the cause, it&#39;s clear to Calvin that there&#39;s no point in discussing things with his Daad!  Dad:  The problem is, you see everything in terms of black and white.  Calvin:  Sometimes that&#39;s the way things are!!

Hobbes:  I guess time weighs more heavily on some people&#39;s hand than others.  Calvin: He&#39;s just jealous because I accomplish so much more than he does.

Well, I thought up a better idea!  I&#39;ll shovel and pack the snow into a big ramp! You can get in the car, rev up to near red line, throw out the clutch, leave a patch of molten rubber out the garage, and zoom up the ramp!  Then we could line barrels and stuff down the driveway and see how many you could clear! Wouldn&#39;t that be great??  I don&#39;t see why some people even have cars.

A snow snake&#39;s got me!  Horrible inner teeth on its separately moving upper jaw bones are pulling me down its frigid gullet! Run for your life!  Susie: At least I have a life..unlike some weidos I know. Calvin:  I suppose if I had two X chromosomes, I&#39;d feel hostile too.

Calvin&#39;s Dad unfair. More freedom.  Later bedtimes fewer baths. Egad! Bad Dad! Dad: No one else at the office talks about this kind of thing.

It&#39;s too much work! It&#39;s boring! It&#39;s slow! I know! I&#39;ll sit on the sled and you pull me up, ok? Run as fast as you can, and zigzag around trees and stuff!  Even my friends don&#39;t do what I want.

Mom: I can&#39;t tell what it is. Can you? Dad: It doesn&#39;t look like anything from here.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d0f2b810df8a01317251005056a9545d|634|900|Calvin:  While lying on my back to make an angel in the snow, I saw a greenish craft appear!  A giant UFO!  A strange unearthy hum it made!  It hovered overhead!  And aliens were moving &#39;round in view ports glowing red! I tried to run for cover, but a hook that they had low&#39;r&#39;d snagged me by my overcoat and hoisted me aboard!  Even then, I tried to fight and though they numbered many, I poked them in their compound eyes and pulled on their antennae! It was no use!  They dragged me to a platform, tied me up, and wired to my cranium a fiendish suction cup!  They turned it on and current coursed across my cerebellum, coaxing from my brain tissue the things I wouldn&#39;t tell &#39;em!  All the math I ever learned, the numbers and equations, were mechanic&#39;ly removed in this brain-draining operation!  My escape was an adventure.  (I won&#39;t tell you what I did.) Suffice to say, I cannot add, so ask some other kid.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f39e95c0df7c01317244005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin: There&#39;s Susie! Heh heh! Watch me knock her fillings loose! Yaaa!  Calvin: You know, I thought Earth&#39;s gravity felt exceptionally strong today.  Hobbes: I guess that explains how you spilled your oatmeal down the heater this morning.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f4e0c2c0df7c01317244005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin: Obviously I can&#39;t throw snowballs at Susie when earth&#39;s gravity has increased.  This is a job for... Hobbes: For? Calvin: Mom must&#39;ve put my cape in the wrong drawer!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f6134ba0df7c01317244005056a9545d|284|900|Hobbes: So who is this a job for?  Calvin: Stupendous man! Mff Ghh!  Hobbes: Super horoes wear snow pants?  Calvin: When there&#39;s snow out, they do! Hobbes: This looks like a real job for stupendous man! Calvin: Well of course the zippers going to get stuck if everyone stands around watching me.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f75471f0df7c01317244005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin: Earth&#39;s excessive gravity is no match for Stupendous Man&#39;s stupendous strength! With muscles of magnitude, the masked man of might rolls a giantic snowball...and flies it high into the stratosphere..where he uses his stupendous vision to locate the diabolical arch-fiend Annoying Girl!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f8986700df7c01317244005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin: From high in the sky, Supendous Man takes advantage of Earth&#39;s strong gravity!  A direct hit!  Stupendous man triumphs! With Annoying Girl vanquished, the whirlwind wonder zooms back to resume his secret identity! Hobbes: Did you save the day?  Calvin: Justice reigns once more! Mom: Calvin, Susie&#39;s Mom just called. I want to talk to you.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f9d5f8b0df7c01317244005056a9545d|285|900|Mom: Susie&#39;s Mom says you dropped a snowball the size of a bowling ball on Susie from a tree. Calvin: It couldn&#39;t have been me! I&#39;m very mild-mannered.  Mom: She described exactly the hood and cape I made you.  Calvin: Why, it must&#39;ve been Stupendous Man, defender of Liberty and Justice! I&#39;m sure Susie deserved whatever she got.  Mom: Listen to me. You could hurt someone that way, and if I ever hear of anything like this again, I&#39;ll take away your costume for good. Got it?  Hobbes: Hmm, this sounds like another job for Stupendous man! Calvin: Actually, it doesn&#39;t sound like quite his type of job.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d41f51e0df8a01317251005056a9545d|630|900|Calvin:  Mom never lets me stay up to watch the TV shows I really want to see.  Hobbes: Why not?  Calvin:  She says they&#39;re too educational. I watched a nature program on TV last night.  Afterward, I asked Dad if life was really nothing more than trying to survive long enough to reproduce before you became food for something else.  Hobbes:  What did he say? Calvin:  Well, he looked at me a minute, and said he didn&#39;t know about the rest of it, but he thought that the importance of reproducing was greatly overrated.  I&#39;ve noticed in those programs how the young males often leave the herd at an early age.  Hobbes: I think it&#39;s good that everyone becomes food.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/fb2f1750df7c01317244005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin: Dad, how do soldiers killing each other solve the world&#39;s problems?  I think grown-ups just act like they know what they&#39;re doing.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/fc6f9620df7c01317244005056a9545d|290|900|Mom: Hi Honey!  How was school?  Calvin: I got stuck in my snow pants. Mom: Uh oh. What happened?  Calvin: Well. The zipper got covered with ice, so I tried to force it. Then my mitten got caught and jammed the zipper.  I tried to pull my snow pants off, but I forgot to take my boots off first so those got stuck, and then the pants got all twisted, so I fell over and finally the teacher had to call two custodians to get me out! So I want to be sure to wear them again tomorrow.

Hobbes: What are you making? Calvin: This is a hoof. Hobbes: A hoof?  Calvin: Right!  This will be a life-size equestrian statue of me!  Hobbes: A new Horseman of Apocalype, hmm? Calvin: I think I&#39;m going to need more clay.

Mom: Another parent-techer conference?!  Calvin: I told her to expect you to deny everything.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/00358ca0df7d01317244005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin: That&#39;s why I&#39;m way over here.

Mom! Mom: What&#39;s the matter??  What&#39;s wrong?!  Calvin: Hobbes wants a second good night kiss. Mom: It&#39;s two in the morning!!  Calvin: He says the first kiss didn&#39;t take. Hobbes: Hmph. I don&#39;t think that one took either.  Calvin: Oh go to sleep.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d748a4f0df8a01317251005056a9545d|633|900|Calvin: I&#39;ve decided to be more of a &quot;people&quot; person, and make more friends.  Hobbes: How come?  Calvin: I don&#39;t get enough presents.  From now on, I&#39;m devoting myself to the cultivation of interpersonal relationships.  After all, no man is an island. We all need love and the support of others.  We&#39;re social beings with social needs.  So as of today, my goal is to be at one with my fellow man, to develop and foster those deep connections that...just a minute... Hey Susie! Heads up!! Ha Ha!!  Augh help help  I&#39;ve changed my mind, Hobbes. People are scum.  Hobbes: I think true happiness can only be found in the wanton indulgence of animals.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/02b16200df7d01317244005056a9545d|288|900|Mom: Augh!  Who did this?! Calvin as Private Eye: The dam&#39;es scream hit an octave usually reserved for calling dogs, but it meant I had a case, and the sound of greenbacks slapping across my palm is music to my ears any day. After all, I&#39;m not an opera critic. I&#39;m a private eye.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/03f06230df7d01317244005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin as Private Eye: I keep two magnums in my desk. One&#39;s a gun, and I keep it loaded. The other&#39;s a bottle and it keeps me loaded. I&#39;m Tracer Bullet. I&#39;m a professional snoop.  It&#39;s a tough job, but then, I&#39;m a tough guy. Some people don&#39;t like an audience when they work. Enough of them have told me so with blunt instruments that I&#39;m a phrenologist&#39;s dream come true. Snooping pays the bills, though. Especially Bill, my bookie and Bill, my probation officer. So when a tall brunette opened my door with a case for me, my heart did a few calisthenics and I took the job.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/053551a0df7d01317244005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin as Tracer Bullet:  The dame said she had a case. She sounded like a case herself, but I can&#39;t choose my clients. She was the pushy type. The kind who&#39;d break your heart, or maybe your arms. I hurried over.  Either she had a psychotic decorator, or her place had been ransacked by someone in a big hurry. Mom: Well?! How do you explain this?  Calvin: The dame was hysterical. Dames usually are.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|2|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/02/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/06728540df7d01317244005056a9545d|287|900|Mom: What have you got to say for yourself? Calvin: Don&#39;t touch anything. I&#39;m looking for clues.  Calvin: The click of a hammer being cocked behind my head focused my thoughts like only a loaded .38 can. The dame had set me up! She didn&#39;t want me to solve the case at all!  She just wanted a patsy to pin the crime on! Mom: Well? Calvin: I didn&#39;t like the way this story was shaping up, so I decided to write a new ending with my .45 automatic as co-author.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/07cfc600df7d01317244005056a9545d|292|900|Calvin:  I introduced the dame to a friend who&#39;s very close to my heart.  Just a little down and left, to be specific.  My friend is an eloquent speaker.  He made three profound arguments while I excused myself from the room.  I always leave when the talk gets philosophical.  Mom:  You&#39;re in real trouble now, young man!!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/09107520df7d01317244005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin:  I&#39;d just finished putting the puzzle pieces together when the dame&#39;s hired goon jumped out of nowhere and practiced for his chiropractic degree.  When he was done, an all-percussion symphony was playing in my head, and the acoustics were incredible.  The orchestra went on a ten-city tour of my brain, and I had a season pass with front row seats.  I had figured out who trashed the dame&#39;s living room, but since she wasn&#39;t my client any more, I felt no need to divulge the information.  Besides, the culprit happened to be a close buddy of mine.  I closed the case.  Hobbes:  I guess we should&#39;ve played outside, huh?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|3|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/03|https://assets.amuniversal.com/dabeb980df8a01317251005056a9545d|632|900|Calvin (Spaceman Spiff):  The distant planet Z-12. Distant, that is, to everyone but Spaceman Spiff!  The fearless explorer Spaceman Spiff cruises over the desolate dunes of an uncharted planet!  No vegetation covers the rolling terrain. Millions of years of harsh exposure without an atmosphere has swept the surface clean.  What strange chemicals must compose this alien soil!  Crossing a rift, the rocks abruptly change color!  Zounds! A huge mountain suddenly rises out of the plain! Our hero pulls up!  Over the top, Spiff discovers it&#39;s not a mountain at all! The whole landscape is...is bedding for a horrendous monster!  Dad: ZG! Hf! Whuh? All right, what time is it?  Calvin: The creature appears hostile! With no time to lose, our hero readies a hydro bomb!

Calvin:  Nothing so far.  Mom:  &quot;So far&quot;?  Calvin:  Well, you never know.  Something could happen today.  And if anything does, by golly, I&#39;m going to be ready for it!  Mom:  I need a suit like that.

How come we don&#39;t ever go on vacations like that?  Dad:  Vacations are all just a matter of comparison.  Calvin:  Huh?  Dad:  We spend a week in cold, uncomfortable tents each year so living here the rest of the time seems like a luxury cruise.  If your trips are unpleasant, your whole life is a vacation!  Calvin:  Please tell me I&#39;m adopted.

I think it&#39;s a religion.  Hobbes:  A religion?  Calvin:  Yeah.  All these equations are like miracles.  You take two numbers and when you add them, they magically become one new number!  No one can say how it happens.  You either believe it or you don&#39;t.  This whole book is full of things that have to be accepted on faith!  It&#39;s a religion!  Hobbes:  And in the public schools no less.  Call a lawer.  Calvin:  As a math atheist, I should be excused from this.

A human can hardly do a quarter of that.  What a joke!  Calvin:  You think cats are so great!  Well humans don&#39;t have to be so fast or so strong because we&#39;re much smarter!  If cats are so great, how come they don&#39;t have cars, or rockets, or bombs, or nuclear...um...reactors, or...or...I mean...  Hobbes:  And we can see six times better at night than you can!  Six times!  And boy, talk about agility!  Calvin:  Hmph.

Calvin:  Oh, I&#39;m real sorry!

I landed on chance!  I get to take a card!  Calvin:  Oh no!  Hobbes:  It says, &quot;Defraud the bank.  Computer scam diverts assets to your account.  Collect $5,000.&quot;  Calvin:  $5,000?!  Hobbes:  I think I&#39;ll buy a few dozen hotels.  Calvin:  Ooh, you just wait till I land on chance!  Monopoly is more fun when you make your own chance cards.

He says that if the playing field was level and we didn&#39;t have guns, people would be nothing but cat food!  Tell him that&#39;s not...  There!  10 cents.  Hobbes:  We bet a quarter, you chiseler.

Mom:  Oh, you&#39;re not?  Calvin:  Nope!  I&#39;m staying home and watching television all day!  Apparently I was misinformed.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/170d57f0df7d01317244005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Today for Show and Tell I brought one of my own patent pending inventions!  I have in my hand an invisible cretinizer!  One shot renders the victim a babbling simp, a dolt, an utter moron!  Ronald:  Oh sure, Calvin!  Give us a break!  Calvin:  As Ronald proves, it&#39;s quite effective at long range.  Ronald:  Hey!

Calvin:  Nope.  I wish we lived in the Badlands of Montana.  It&#39;s easier there because erosion often exposes the bones.  Here though, you just have to start digging and hope for the best.  Hobbes:  Hence the systematic approach, hmm?  Calvin:  Right.  I guess I&#39;ll have to move that sapling.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e2825c30df8a01317251005056a9545d|631|900|Calvin: Nyup nchyup.  I think a burp died trying to get out of my mouth.  I&#39;m thirsty.  Monster eyes!  Help help! It&#39;s after me!  It&#39;s got me! I can feel its terrible fangs!!  Dad: Sleepwalking again!  Mom: Let&#39;s go back to bed, honey.  You had a nightmare.  Calvin: Oh, it was you! It sure is creepy having a friend whose eyes glow in the dark.  Hobbes: It&#39;s so we can see people who might be sneaking out of bed to fix a snack without making arrangements to share.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/198feec0df7d01317244005056a9545d|288|900|Mom:  Well look at you!  Don&#39;t you look nice and neat!  Calvin:  Yes, I believe in the importance of good grooming.  Speaking of which, I&#39;d better get in the tub if I want to be in bed on time.  Mom:  Just what are you up to?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/1ad5b060df7d01317244005056a9545d|288|900|Mom:  I heard Calvin splashing in the tub, but there&#39;s no water on the floor.  His towel is hung to dry!  The toothpaste cap is on!  There&#39;s no mess anywhere!  And you&#39;re already in bed??  Calvin:  Would you check over my homework tonight, so I can correct any mistakes in the morning before school?  Thanks, Mom.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/1c3b36c0df7d01317244005056a9545d|283|900|Calvin:  Good morning, Mom.  Mom:  You&#39;re up and dressed?!  I didn&#39;t even call you!  Calvin:  I like to get up early so the morning isn&#39;t rushed.  And with the extra time, I can review my assignments and be better prepared for class.  Mom:  I&#39;m bracing myself for when the other shoe drops.  Calvin:  Don&#39;t get up.  I&#39;ll fix my own breakfast.  Do we have any prunes?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/1d7b79b0df7d01317244005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  I made my bed and I put my breakfast dishes away!  I&#39;m off to school now!  Mom:  Have a good day.  Calvin:  Thank you.  I&#39;ll study hard.  A good education is invaluable.  Calvin:  This is working out great!  Hobbes:  I can&#39;t believe your mom thinks that&#39;s you.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/1ec201b0df7d01317244005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  I&#39;ve got to say, Hobbes, I&#39;ve really perfected my old duplicator this time!  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll grant it needed perfecting.  Calvin:  It was so simple to add an ethicator!  I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of it before!  Now, instead of making a complete duplicate of me, I&#39;ve made a duplicate of just my good side!  He does all the work and I get all the credit!  He&#39;s a total sap!  I know!  I know the answer!  Miss Wormwood:  You&#39;ve gotten so many, let&#39;s let someone else try this one, ok, dear?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2001b510df7d01317244005056a9545d|285|900|Hobbes:  Last time you made a duplicate of yourself, the duplicate made duplicates, remember?  It was a mess!  Calvin:  True, but thanks to the ethicator, it can&#39;t happen this time!  By only duplicating my good side, I&#39;ve ensured that this duplicate won&#39;t cause any trouble!  He&#39;s a complete boy scout!  There&#39;s nothing this twerp likes better than making everyone&#39;s life easier!  He lives for it!  Hobbes:  The ethicator must&#39;ve done some deep digging to unearth him!  Calvin:  Talk about someone easy to exploit!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e5ebdd50df8a01317251005056a9545d|632|900|Calvin:  AAAAAAAA  Mom: I think these comic books he reads are much too grim.  Dad: Must be! Just look at him twitch.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2146b150df7d01317244005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  When you&#39;re done putting my toys away, you can get to work on my math assignment.  Ok.  Isn&#39;t this the life?  We get to do whatever we want while goody-two-shoes here does all the work!  He doesn&#39;t even complain!  Virtue is its own reward.  He doesn&#39;t complain, but his self-righteousness sure gets on my nerves.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/228b4b00df7d01317244005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Hello, may I carry your books for you?  Susie Derkins:  Why?  So you can throw them in a puddle or something?  Forget it!  Calvin:  I wouldn&#39;t do that!  Susie:  Yeah, you&#39;d probably do something worse!  You&#39;re not touching my books, Calvin!  Calvin:  Strictly speaking, I&#39;m not Calvin.  I&#39;m the physical manifestation of Calvin&#39;s good side.  Susie Derkins:  If that was true, you&#39;d be a lot smaller.  Calvin:  Boy, have I heard that joke a lot.  Susie Derkins:  And if you think you can get my books by acting even weirder than usual, think again!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/23d313e0df7d01317244005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  Say, Calvin, that nice girl down the street seems to think you&#39;re a total jerk.  Who, Susie?  You weren&#39;t talking to Susie, were you?  Yes.  I offered to carry her books and she...  You did what?!  She clearly doesn&#39;t trust you at all.  Oh, man!  Nobody saw you, did they?!  They&#39;ll think it was me!  You want to make it look like I like her?!  She seemed upset, so this afternoon I took her some flowers I picked, but...  Aughh!  Aughh!  Aughh!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/251f1900df7d01317244005056a9545d|289|900|Hobbes:  I hear you&#39;re pretty smooth with the ladies!  Woo woo woo!  Calvin:  Oh, knock it off!  Its that darn duplicate and you know it!  Man, he&#39;s gone too far!  I don&#39;t mind if he cleans my room and gets good grades, but by golly, I draw the line at being nice to Susie!  Can&#39;t that duplicate tell she&#39;s a girl?!  Hobbes:  Oh, I think he&#39;s figured that out.  I saw him cutting hearts out of red construction paper!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|29|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/29|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2666c710df7d01317244005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Don&#39;t tell me my duplicate is writing Susie mash notes!!  Hobbes:  You little charmer, you!  Calvin:  I&#39;m the dictator-for-life of the Get Rid of Slimy Girls club!  My reputation!  My honor!  My principles!  We&#39;ve got to stop him!  Oh no!  He&#39;s not in my room!  He must be on his way to Susie&#39;s house!  Hobbes:  You&#39;re probably getting smooches right now!  Big wet ones, I bet!  Susie Derkins:  More sarcasm?!  You come here again and I&#39;ll clobber you, Calvin.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/27c29d80df7d01317244005056a9545d|286|900|Susie Derkins:  You again?!  Calvin:  Was I here before?  Susie Derkins:  Are you crazy?!  You were here just two minutes ago!  Calvin:  Uh-oh.  I&#39;m not still here, am I?  Susie Derkins:  You&#39;re standing right there!  Calvin:  Well anyone can see that!  Am I here anywhere else?!  Calvin:  Sheesh.  Who can fathom the feminine mind?  Hobbes:  I like &#39;em anyway.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|3|31|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/31|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e944d950df8a01317251005056a9545d|636|900|Susie: Uh oh, here comes Calvin.  The incurable weirdness poster child.  Hi Calvin. What&#39;s with the mask and bucket?  Calvin:  Hmph.  This is a poem! Please do what you&#39;re told!  And here is a bucket of water, ice-cold.  Please take this water, and dump it on me! Don&#39;t hesitate! Do it A.S.A.P.  Just wait till you touch the &quot;pernicious poem place&quot;!!  Ooooh you&#39;ll be sorry then!  Hobbes:  Wheee! I love playing Calvinball!  This is a bag flag zone!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/290243c0df7d01317244005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin:  There you are!  There you are!  What&#39;s the big idea giving Susie a mushy Valentine?!  Are you nuts?!?  She wouldn&#39;t even accept it!  You&#39;re such a jerk, she always thinks you&#39;re up to something!  Who are you calling a jerk, you namby-pamby goody-goody!  You, you self-centered conniving brat!  Hobbes:  Wow, how existential can you get?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2a3f38d0df7d01317244005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  So it&#39;s a fight you want, is it?!  Why, I&#39;ll tear you limb from...  Yeah?  Yeah?  Oops!  I had an evil thought!  Hobbes:  Another casualty of applied metaphysics.  Calvin:  My ethicator machine must&#39;ve had a built-in moral compromise spectral release phantasmatron!  I&#39;m a genius!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|3|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/03|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2b7c1f70df7d01317244005056a9545d|283|900|Hobbes:  You&#39;re the only person I know whose good side is prone to badness.  Calvin:  That&#39;s why he evaporated.  He could only be perfectly good as an abstraction.  In his human manifestation, he wanted to throttle me.  He spectralized just in time!  Hobbes:  Fascinating.  Calvin:  Yes.  Hobbes:  Of course, now you have to do you homework yourself.  Calvin:  Actually, now that my good side is no longer a physical being, I find him that much easier to ignore.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|4|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/04|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2cd35ba0df7d01317244005056a9545d|285|900|Dad:  Well, that&#39;s the end of chapter one.  We&#39;ll stop here.  Calvin:  No, read the whole book, ok?  Dad:  Calvin, there&#39;s a hundred more pages and it&#39;s late.  We&#39;ll read another chapter tomorrow.  Calvin:  No, no!  Finish it tonight!  Dad:  Gee, you must really like this.  Calvin:  I have to write a paper on it tomorrow.

Things don&#39;t bug you if you don&#39;t think about them.  So from now on, I simply won&#39;t think about anything I don&#39;t like, and I&#39;ll be happy all the time!  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a pretty silly and irresponsable way to live?  Calvin:  What a pretty afternoon.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2f5ba760df7d01317244005056a9545d|283|900|Hobbes:  What are you doing out in the rain?  Calvin:  I&#39;m engaged in a contest of wills!  It&#39;s me against nature!  Which of us is going to give up first?  Is nature going to give up and stop raining, or am I going to give up and go inside?  So far, it&#39;s undecided, but I&#39;m determined to win!  Oooh, big noise!  You don&#39;t scare me!  Keep it coming!  I&#39;m not going in!  Poor guy just couldn&#39;t stand the suspense.

As of today, I will no longer respond to the name &quot;Calvin&quot;.  From now on, I wish to be addressed as &quot;Calvin the Bold&quot;.  Mom:  Calvin the Bold?  Calvin:  Right that&#39;s my new name for the rest of my life.  Mom:  How about Calvin the Deranged?  Calvin:  Also, Calvin the Bold will begin referring to himself in the third person.

Calvin?  Calvin:  Who??  Miss Wormwood:  You!  Calvin:  Calvin the Bold demands  that he be addressed by his full title for any response.  Principal:  Back again, hmm, Calvin?  Calvin:  Who??
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/33476200df7d01317244005056a9545d|290|900|Dad:  Calvin the Bold!  Calvin:  Yes?  Dad:  Kneel.  Calvin:  Huh??  What?  Kneel?  Dad:  By the finite patience vested in me, I hereby dub thee &quot;Mud.&quot;  You may rise.  Calvin:  My name is Mud?!  Mr. Subtlety drives home another point.

Calvin:  How do ugly things like octopuses and hairy bugs reproduce?  Are they actually attracted to each other?  Mom:  It&#39;s 3 AM!  Go to sleep!  Calvin:  Come to think of it, I wonder how people are attracted to each other.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s why they close their eyes when they smooch.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1991|4|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/04/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/35c609f0df7d01317244005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  Look at what this dumb toaster did to my toast!  It didn&#39;t cook it enough the first time, so I pushed it down again and now one side&#39;s burned and the other&#39;s hardly singed!  That toaster ruined my toast!  Dad:  And yet...somehow...life goes on.  Calvin:  Beneath that larger perspective is a guy who doesn&#39;t want to spring for a new toaster.

Calvin:  Times sure change, huh dad?  Ever notice how dad brings up subjects he doesn&#39;t want to talk about?

There&#39;s Mars. An there&#39;s Jupiter.  And I&#39;m stuck here.  On a clear night like this, you realize how incomprensibly vast the universe really is.  I wonder what early man must&#39;ve thought as he watched the skies.  He&#39;d see he was an infinitesimal part of creation, but he&#39;d have no understanding of planets or stars or comets or anything.  Imagine how big and mysterious the night would&#39;ve seemed to him!  I&#39;ll bet he felt very fragile and afraid, don&#39;t you think?  ...Hobbes?  Hobbes?? H-hello?  Anybody?? Augh!  Hobbes: I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s what he felt like! Saber-tooth tiger food!  Calvin: From now on I&#39;m going to stay inside at night and watch TV.

We&#39;re born at this crack and we die at that crack.  Now we find ourselves somewhere inside the square, and in the process of walking out of it.  Suddenly we realize our time in here is fleeting.  Is our quick experience here pointless?  Does anything we say or do in here really matter?  Have we done anything important?  Have we been happy?  Have we made the most of these precious few footsteps??

First you drink half the milk in your thermos.  That leaves enough room so you can wad the rest of your lunch in there.  See, here goes my jelly sandwich and a banana!  Let it soak for a minute, then shake it all up into sludge and choke it down!  Your stomach won&#39;t know the difference, and it saves your teeth undue wear and tear!  Nobody likes my great ideas in action.

In fact, looking back, I have only one regret.  Hobbes:  What&#39;s that?  Calvin:  I regret I wasn&#39;t born with opposable toes.

Yes, stand up and hail his humbleness now!  May his wisdom prevail!  Hobbes:  Three cheers for first tiger and el presidente, Hobbes, the delight of all cognoscenti!  He&#39;s savvy!  He has a prodigious IQ, and lots of panahce, as all tigers do!  In his fancy chapeau, he&#39;s a leader with taste!  May his orders be heeded and his views be embraced!  Calvin:  You can tell this is a great club by the way we start our meetings!

First tiger Hobbes will present our financial report.  Hobbes:  Wait, we didn&#39;t sing the G.R.O.S.S. anthem.  Calvin:  We sing that at the end of the meeting.  Hobbes:  I want to sing it now.  Calvin:  We can&#39;t.  We have to follow proper protocol!  See?  It says on the agenda that we sing the anthem last!  Hobbes:  Ohhohh grohoss best club in the cosmos...  Calvin:  Stop that, you anarchist!

Hobbes:  Well you get five demerits for not taking off your hat during its hallowed refrain!  Calvin:  You can&#39;t give me demerits!  I outrank you.  Hobbes:  Ha!  You&#39;re just a figurehead!  Your duties are ceremonial!  I have all the real responsibilities!  Calvin:  What?!  I&#39;m dictator-for-life!  I have ten times the importance of a lowly first tiger!  A hundred times!  A million times!  Hobbes:  If  you&#39;re so important, how come you sing the soprano part of our anthem?  Calvin:  That&#39;s just till my voice changes!

You are hereby demoted to &quot;club mascot&quot;!  Hobbes:  Oh yeah?!  Well you can be &quot;club chowder head,&quot; because I quit!  I&#39;m forming my own club, and it&#39;s going to be a lot better than this one!  Calvin:  Ha!  Your sorry club won&#39;t have a cool acronym for a name, I&#39;ll bet!  Hobbes:  It will too!  My club is called &quot;C.A.D&quot;  Calvin:  C.A.D.?  What&#39;s that supposed to stand for?  Hobbes:  &quot;Calvin&#39;s a dope&quot;!  Calvin:  That&#39;s not a name for a club!

Hobbes:  An insult!  I declare eternal war on your club!  Calvin:  Go ahead!  From now on we&#39;re bitter enemies!  Hobbes:  Wait till you see my cunning strategies!  I&#39;ll have maps and secret codes!  Calvin:  I&#39;ll have strategies!  I&#39;ll have maps!  I&#39;ll have codes!  They&#39;ll all be better than yours!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m going to write myself a message in code right now!  It says, &quot;Calvin smells like a baboon!&quot;  Calvin:  Ha!  I broke your code already!  And I do not!

Hobbes:  Who needs your stinky club?!  I&#39;ve got my own club!  My club dedicates itself to the destruction of your club!  Calvin:  Good!  It&#39;s a battle to the finish!  This is total war!

Just give me the mushy apples!  Susie:  Mushy apples?  Who are you talking to?  Calvin:  Susie, don&#39;t move, ok?  Stay exactly where you are.

Calvin:  We were getting rid of slimy girls!  That&#39;s our club!  Mom:  Well stop it!  You know better than that!  I think you&#39;d better come inside.  Calvin:  You can tell this is a great club because we always get in trouble for following our charter!

Well, this morning I did.  Big deal!  They smelled like a bunch of dumb flowers!  It was the most mundane experience I&#39;ve ever had!  Who&#39;s got time for this nonsense!  I&#39;m a busy guy!  I&#39;ve got things to do!  The last thing I need is to stand around with my nose in some silly plant!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m glad you somehow found the time for this edifying conversation.

But since you never know when the right time is going to be, I figure the trick is to find the right place, and just hang around!  Hobbes:  Being with you, it&#39;s just one epiphany after another.  Calvin:  And if the right place is in front of the drug store, we could read comic books while we wait!

I don&#39;t ever get what I want when I want it! I always have to wait!  Look how long it&#39;s taken me to be six years old!  Practially forever! When do I get to drive?!  When can I go see gory, violent movies?! Why do I have to wait till I&#39;m older?!  People say life&#39;s a journey, but I&#39;m tired of wasting my precious time in transit! I say, if you want to find out where the road goes, get in the fast lane and hit the gas! Spare me the scenery and let&#39;s get where we&#39;re going! I&#39;m a busy guy! I&#39;ve got places to be!  Gosh, that was over quick.

He can&#39;t just stay the way he is.  But a tiger grows up and stays a tiger.  Why is that?  Hobbes:  No room for improvement.  Calvin:  Of all the luck, my parents had to be humans.  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t take it too hard.  Humans provide some very important protein.

Notice how I keep my jaw slack, so my mouth hangs open.  I try not to swallow either, so I drool, and I keep my eyes half-focused, so I don&#39;t use any muscles at all.  I take a passive entertainment and extend the passivity to my entire being.  I wallow in my lack of participation and response.  I&#39;m utterly inert.  Hobbes:  I&#39;m going to leave before you start attracting flies.  Calvin:  I can almost feel my neural transmitters shutting down.

My head somehow got twisted completely around!  I&#39;m facing backward!  Look!  I can read the tag on my shirt!  I can see down my own back! ...Oh, wait.  There&#39;s my belly button.  I must just have my shirt on backward.  Never mind.  I&#39;ve got my head on straight after all.  Mom:  Oh.  I wouldn&#39;t go that far.

He weighed six tons or more! He epitomized the concept of the killer carnivore! His jaws had teeth like railroad spikes with fore and aft serrations! This dental hardware was designed for quick eviscerations! With thrashing bites and awful roars the T. Rex would attack!  He was, it&#39;s clear, a savage Mesozoic maniac! Imagine, then, the panic, caused the horror and the mayhem when this monster came to town and ate some folks this a.m! It was a sight few will forget! He lunged into the crowd! The mulitude became unglued! Their screams were long and loud!  People pushed to get away! The elderly and small were trampled underfoot by the advancing human will!  Little Tim was on an errand with his brother, Howard.  They dawdled by the candy shop and both boys were devoured. A camera crew from channel three arrived in town to give a live report.  At this they failed, because they didn&#39;t live. At last the menace ate his fill. The big Tyrannosaur stomped away to parts unknown where he had lived before.  Tyrannosaurs, though rarely seen, are certainly still around. And no one knows just where or when the next one will be found.  Mom: Blow your nose, son.

Calvin:  I quit doing homework.  Homework is bad for my self-esteem.  Hobbes:  It is?  Calvin:  Sure!  It sends the message that I don&#39;t know enough!  All that emphasis on right answers makes me feel bad when I get them wrong.  So instead of trying to learn, I&#39;m just concentrating on liking myself the way I am.  Hobbes:  Your self-esteem is enhanced by remaining an ignoramus?  Calvin:  Please!  Let&#39;s call it &quot;informationally impaired.&quot;
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|2|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/02/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/c3a30bc0df8d01317256005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  See, Hobbes, we shouldn&#39;t need accomplishments to feel good about ourselves.  Self-esteem shouldn&#39;t be conditional.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve stopped doing homework.  I don&#39;t need to learn things to like myself.  I&#39;m fine the way I am.  Hobbes:  So the secret to good self-esteem is to lower your expectations to the point where they&#39;re already met?  Calvin:  Right.  We should take pride in our mediocrity.  Hobbes:  Remind me to invest overseas.  Calvin:  I think this snowman is good enough, don&#39;t you?

He said, when I&#39;m older, I&#39;ll discover that there are few pleasures greater than learning.  So I said, fine, I&#39;ll learn when I&#39;m older!  Hobbes:  What did he say?  Calvin:  He said, if I didn&#39;t start cracking books now, this would be as old as I&#39;d get.  Hobbes:  Sounds like you learned something already.

They don&#39;t understand me and I don&#39;t understand them.  It&#39;s hopeless!  I&#39;m related to people I don&#39;t relate to.

Do we turn around and retreat to the stupefying security of home and hearth?  Or do we brave the descent, risk demise, and experience the flood of somatic sensation that screams we are alive, gloriously alive, however temporarily?? ...Hobbes?  Hobbes:  I thought the question was rhetorical.  Calvin:  The other way, though!

Calvin:  The good news is that you have a high name-recognition factor.  All the household six-year-olds polled were able to identify you as &quot;dad.&quot;  This recognition, however, is linked to the fact that your policies are universally deplored.  There&#39;s talk about voting you out of office and making mom &quot;dad&quot;.  Dad:  I see.  And what do you know about this?  Mom:  My first act will be to make you do the cooking.  Calvin:  Whoa!  That changes everything!

When most kids make a snowball, they just mush a bunch of snow together. Everyone&#39;s a slave to efficiency! No time for aesthetics! No love of things for their own sake! But when I make a snowball, it&#39;s a work of art!  This snow, for example, is just a little too powdery. It won&#39;t sting properly.  I prefer a wetter snow; something with some weight! Something that will really knock the wind out of the recipient!  And how much loose rubble and dirt is acceptable before it affects the aerodynamics?  Do you get better spin with an ellipsoid or a true sphere! Nobody condiders these things any more! It&#39;s a lost tradition, I tell you!  My snowballs aren&#39;t assembly line productions! They take me longer to make, but each one is a unique masterpiece! That&#39;s why I sign them. Watch this- Hey, Susie!   It&#39;s a crass culture, Hobbes.  Shoddy and quick is all anybody knows.  Hobbes: Artist always suffer.

He wasn&#39;t?  Huh!  Well, Hobbes took your chair.  Sorry.  Hobbes:  I like my chairs pre-warmed.  Calvin:  You owe me.

Hobbes:  Why do you need a grant?  Calvin:  I&#39;m on the cutting edge of art!  My work deserves public support!  Hobbes:  What if the public doesn&#39;t like your work?  Calvin:  They&#39;re not supposed to like it!  This is avant-garde stuff!  I&#39;m criticizing the lowbrows who can&#39;t appreciate great art like this!  Hobbes:  But you&#39;ll take their money.  Calvin:  What do you want me to do, suffer?!

Calvin:  Actually it&#39;s very avant-garde.  This is my new art movement, &quot;neo-regionalism.&quot;  I&#39;m appealing to popular nostalgia for the simple values of rural america 50 years ago.  I figure the public will eat this up and I&#39;ll make a fortune.  Hobbes:  So how is this avant-garde?  Calvin:  It&#39;s secretly ironic.

Dad:  Oh?  Calvin:  Right!  Being young and impressionable, I&#39;m the helpless victim of countless bad influences!  An unwholesome culture panders to my undeveloped values and pushes me to maleficence.  I take no responsibility for my behavior!  I&#39;m an innocent pawn!  It&#39;s society&#39;s fault!  Dad:  Then you need to build more character.  Go shovel the walk.  Calvin:  These discussions never go where they&#39;re supposed to.

Go ahead and throw it!  I&#39;m not scared!  You couldn&#39;t hit the side of a barn!  C&#39;mon, throw it!  I dare you!  Seriously, you could never have done that if my taunts hadn&#39;t boosted your adrenalin.  Hobbes:  I can only find one of your socks.

We have houses, electricity, plumbing, heat...Maybe we&#39;re so sheltered and comfortable that we&#39;ve lost touch with the natural world and forgotten our place in it.  Maybe we&#39;ve lost our awe of nature. That&#39;s why I want to ask you, as a tiger, a wild animal close to nature, what you think we&#39;re put on earth to do. What&#39;s our purpose in life?  Why are we here?  Hobbes: We&#39;re here to devour each other alive. Calvin: turn on the lights!  Turn up the heat!

Shovel the walk!  That&#39;s all I&#39;m good for around here.  What about my powerful intellect?!  My budding genius is being squandered!  I aspire to more than brute slave labor!  These hands!  These amazing hands are destined to create undreamt-of wonders, yet here they&#39;re worn to the bone in unfulfilling drudgery!  What a monstrous injustice!  Geez, don&#39;t tell me lunch isn&#39;t ready!

Yes, I&#39;m wondering if you sell catapults.  No??  Well, I&#39;m looking for something that can deliver a 50-pound payload of snow on a small feminine target.  Can you suggest something?  Hello?  I don&#39;t understand how some of these places stay in business.

Get up before you miss the bus!  Dad: Well, look who&#39;s finally up! It&#39;s Mr. Sunshine! You know, Calvin, from now on, you&#39;re going to bed earlier.  This dragging out of bed late with a surly attitude every morning is going to stop. You&#39;re only kidding yourself, bucko. Bedtime is 7:00.  We should&#39;ve adopted a 25 year-old with his own apartment.

Hobbes: Lots!  Calvin: Yeah? Like what?  Hobbes: I&#39;m not telling.  Calvin: Why not? Hobbes: It&#39;s a sophisticated thing.  Calvin: Sophisticated?! Whaddaya mean sophisticated?? I&#39;m sophisticated! Why won&#39;t you talk about it?  Hobbes: Nice weather today. Calvin: Rrrrrgh!! You know something and you won&#39;t tell me what it is!  Hobbes: Maybe when you&#39;re older.  Calvin: When I&#39;m older?! Why can&#39;t you tell me now?!  Hobbes: Some things you wouldn&#39;t understand.  Calvin: Ha!  I bet you don&#39;t know anything about love!  That&#39;s why you won&#39;t tell me!!  Hobbes: If that&#39;s what you want to believe, go ahead.  Calvin: Tell me!  Hobbes: No! Calvin: Tell me!  Hobbes: No! Calvin: Tell me!  Hobbes: No! No! No!Calvin: Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!  Hobbes: No! No! No! No!  Calvin: Look, just give me a hint, ok? One hint, c&#39;mon! Hobbes: ok, here: &quot;Snoogy-woogy wips.&quot; Calvin: Eww  Hobbes: See?  I told you you weren&#39;t old enough.

Rrrrrrrummm.  Aughh!  Mom:  I don&#39;t understand why you have to take your clothes off to play cars.  It&#39;s very weird.  Calvin:  Just give &#39;em here, ok?

Mom:  Go look at the clock and see.  Calvin:  What&#39;s the weather like outside today?  Mom:  Go step outside and see.  Calvin:  How fast can our car go?  Mom:  Go...nice try.  Calvin:  Phooey.

Rock pretends it&#39;s still rebellious with its video posturing, but who believes it?  The stars are 45-year-old zillionaires or they endorse soft drinks!  The &quot;revolution&quot; is a capitalist industry!  Give me a break!  Fortunately, I&#39;ve found some protest music for today&#39;s youth!  This stuff really offends mom and dad!  Hobbes:  Easy-listening Muzak?  Calvin:  I play it real quiet, too.

I hate school!  I&#39;d rather do anything than go to school!  Dad:  OK, how about if I go to school and you get a job?    Dad:  You&#39;ll like working till evening and being responsible for the subsistence of your family, with a whiny kid&#39;s griping for reward.  Calvin:  It&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s so much in life to look forward to.

I want to be a one-in-a-million, overnight success!  I want the world handed to me on a silver platter!  Hobbes:  Good luck.  Calvin:  Surely you concede I deserve it!

Can&#39;t you drive any faster??  Dad: I don&#39;t like to go much faster than this.  Calvin: Can I drive then?  I&#39;ll bet I could go real fast!  Dad: Hmm...well, ok, sure.  I&#39;ll pull over.  Calvin: Don&#39;t worry about a thing, Dad! Which pedal is the clutch?  Dad: The left one. Then brake, then gas. Calvin: Here we go! Hang on! Mom: Ooh, this is faster!  Dad: Blow the horn! Make everyone get out of our way! Mom: Wheee! We&#39;re airborn!  Dad: We&#39;ll get there in no time now! Calvin: We should&#39;ve done this sooner!  Dad: I wonder how fast we&#39;re going. Calvin: Can&#39;t say.  We broke the speedometer. Mom: This is the only way to travel. Mom: We&#39;re passing that jet! Dad: Way to go, Calvin!  Calvin: I like driving! Sighhhh.  How much longer now?  Dad: I told you we&#39;ll get there when we get there.

I&#39;d hear the wind blowing the rain against the window panes and I&#39;d pull the blankets up, get all toasty and cozy, and fall back asleep.  Instead, I&#39;m out here, cold and wet, waiting for the school bus to take me to the gulag.  Hobbes:  Yeah, I hope the sheets are still warm when I get back in.  Calvin:  Rub it in, Hobbes.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|3|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/03/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f72b41f0df8d01317256005056a9545d|295|900|Calvin:  Hey dad, look at this commercial.  How come you don&#39;t drive a cool sports car like that guy?  Dad:  That car costs $40,000.  Calvin:  And look at the babe he&#39;s with.  How come mom doesn&#39;t dress like that?  Dad:  Yeah, why don&#39;t you dress like that?  Mom:  Because your adolescent fantasies require an adolescent model with implants,...honey.  Calvin:  Maybe you guys need to drink more beer.

Mom:  Calvin, the fact that these bands haven&#39;t killed themselves in ritual self-sacrifice shows that they&#39;re just in it for the money like everyone else.  It&#39;s all for effect.  If you want to shock and provoke, be sincere about it.  Calvin:  Mainstream commercial nihilism can&#39;t be trusted?!  Mom:  &#39;Fraid not, kiddo.  Calvin:  Childhood is so disillusioning.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|3|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/03/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/fa611550df8d01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  People don&#39;t realize what a burden it is being a genius like me.  It&#39;s not easy having a mind that operates on a higher plane than everyone else&#39;s!  People just refuse to see that I&#39;m the crux of all history, a boy of destiny!  Hobbes:  I suppose one could recognize a boy of destiny by his planet-and-star underpants.  Calvin:  Another trenchant comment by a jealous lesser intellect.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|3|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/03/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/fc19e0f0df8d01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  Mom, from now on, I don&#39;t want to be introduced to people as plain &quot;Calvin.&quot;  I want to be introduced as &quot;Calvin, boy of destiny.&quot;  Mom:  Boy of destiny??  Calvin:  But you have to say it right.  Pause a little after &quot;boy,&quot; and say &quot;destiny&quot; a bit slower and deeper for emphasis.  Say it, &quot;Boy...of dessstiny,&quot; like that!  Mom:  I think I&#39;m going to stop introducing you altogether.  Calvin:  I wish you had some cymbals to crash after you said it.

Very good.  Here is yours, Calvin.  By the way, you can stop signing your work &quot;Calvin, boy of destiny,&quot; and I think your time would be better spent studying than drawing &quot;official notary seals&quot; at the bottom.  Susie:  Boy of destiny?!  Calvin:  That&#39;s right.  Boy of destiny!  Susie:  Everyone I know thinks your destiny is a private cage in the primate house.  Calvin:  Your destiny is to have a smile that&#39;s all gums.

Calvin:  Apparently I rate just below bugs with her!  Hobbes:  And she complains you don&#39;t help out around the house.

Calvin:  Oh...oh yeah??  What really bugs me is knowing I&#39;ll probably come up with a much sharper retort sometime tonight.

Calvin:  No, but I can recite the secret superhero origin of each member of Captain Napalm&#39;s thermo-nuclear league of liberty.  Miss Wormwood:  See me after class, Calvin.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not dumb.  I just have a command of thoroughly useless information.

Calvin:  I tried to, Miss Wormwood, but the book publisher didn&#39;t use the proper print fixative.  Needless to say, when I picked up the book, all the letters slid off the pages and fell on the floor in a heap of gibberish.  I think my excuses need to be less extemporaneous.

Reference desk, please.  Hello?  Yes, I need a word definition.  Well, that&#39;s the problem.  I don&#39;t know how to spell it and I&#39;m not allowed to say it.  Could you just rattle off all the swear words you know, and I&#39;ll stop you when...hello??  See if I ever vote for their tax levies.

I can stay clean without one!  Look.  I&#39;ll lick myself clean!  That&#39;s what Hobbes does!  See, I&#39;m getting clean just like him!  Hobbes:  Nice going.

Calvin: Our fearless hero escapes!  We join the valiant Spaceman Spiff as he flees his bloatoid captors! Our hero scrambles into his waiting spacecraft! Spiff pressurizes the magnetronic altitude-o-lators and hits the turbo hyper-thrust drive! Instantly our hero blasts to escape velocity! Half a micromoment later, Spiff is just another speck in the infinite sea of outer space!  Alone and free in an endless frontier! Free to roam the heavens in man&#39;s noble quest to investigate the weirdness of the universe!  Hobbes: Wheee, what fun! I&#39;m glad you could come home so early!  Calvin: C&#39;mon ol&#39; buddy!

Calvin:  Yes!  What assurance do I have that this education is adequately preparing me for the 21st century?  Am I getting the skills I&#39;ll need to effectively compete in a tough, global economy?  I want a high-paying job when I get out of here!  I want opportunity!  Miss Wormwood:  In that case, young man, I suggest you start working harder.  What you get out of school depends on what you put into it.  Calvin:  Oh.  Then forget it.

Calvin:  Dad wants to mow the lawn, so he&#39;s making me pick up sticks.  He said I might learn something about the satisfaction that comes from a job well done.  Hobbes:  And did you?  Calvin:  I suppose so.  I think he&#39;s trying to tell me there is none.

I haven&#39;t watched that much!  Think of all the great shows I&#39;ve missed!  I&#39;ve been deprived of cultural references!  I&#39;m ignorant of countless amazing products!  Hurry!  If I watch TV until bedtime, I can get in a few precious extra hours and catch up a bit!  Hobbes:  Remedial vegetation.  Calvin:  Help me learn this theme song, ok?

Raise the ante high enough, and there&#39;s no such thing as scruples!  People will do anything if the price is right!  Hobbes:  What&#39;s  your price?  Calvin:  Two bucks cold cash up front.  Hobbes:  I don&#39;t know which is worse,...that everyone has his price, or that the price is always so low.  Calvin:  I&#39;d make mine higher, but it&#39;s hard to find buyers as it is.

Dad:  I&#39;m busy trying to fix something.  Calvin:  Why bother?  On the rare occasions when you know what the problem is, you usually make it worse and hurt yourself in the process!  I wish I&#39;d noticed the bandage on his hand before I said that.

What&#39;s so funny?  Mom:  Nothing.  Have a good time.  Dad:  Look, I didn&#39;t design this outfit!  It&#39;s practical!  Calvin:  Hey dad, how&#39;d you get your head stuck in a bowling ball?  Ha!  dad:  Next time, I&#39;ll squirt them both with my water bottle.

They don&#39;t accomplish anything!  How do you justify yourself?!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5a89a9e0784b01302116001dd8b71c47|624|900|Calvin: Susie, would you do me a really big favor?  Susie: No. Calvin: Pleeeeese.?? It&#39;s nothing bad. Susie: What is it?  Calvin: Just go up to my house, open the front door and yell, &quot;I&#39;m home.&quot;  Susie: Why should I?!  Calvin: Um..it&#39;s a surprise. I mean, no reason. I just dare you. Susie: Well forget it. Calvin: C&#39;mon. There&#39;s nothing to it! Look, I&#39;ll give you a quarter if you&#39;ll do it! Susie. Ok. Calvin: Oh man, this is going to be great! Yes! Yes! Susie: I&#39;m opening th edoor... Calvin: She&#39;ll never know what hit her! Hee, hee hee! Susie: I&#39;m home!  Thanks for the quarter, sucker.  Calvin: No wait! It didn&#39;t happen! Say it again! Doggone it! What&#39;s wrong with that furball?! Where&#39;s his killer instinct when you really...never never never never never trust a tiger.  Hobbes: I can always tell when it&#39;s you by the bad smell!  Woo hoo hoo!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/1e9f7560df8e01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  I&#39;ve decided I believe in astrology and horoscopes.  Hobbes:  Really?  Calvin:  You bet.  It only makes sense that every facet of our daily lives should depend upon the position of celestial bodies hundreds of millions of miles away.  Look here.  Today I&#39;ll have &quot;many key policies implemented.&quot;  I get to have my way!  Hobbes:  Oh those mischievous planets.  Calvin:  The newspaper couldn&#39;t print it if it weren&#39;t true!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/20675cb0df8e01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  My horoscope says, &quot;Turn-about means circumstances in your favor.  Assert views in confident manner.  Lunar cycle high, many of your key policies will be implemented.&quot;  Isn&#39;t that great?  Today I&#39;m fated to get my way!  The heavens decree it!  Hobbes:  So what are your &quot;key policies&quot;?  Calvin:  First, obviously, is &quot;don&#39;t do homework.&quot;  C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go out and play!  Hobbes:  Here comes your mom and it looks like she has a bone to pick with the moon.  Calvin:  Ha!  Watch me assert my views in a confident manner!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/22367a70df8e01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Hobbes:  Your mom didn&#39;t care much about the lunar sanction of your no-homework policy, did she?  Calvin:  Hmph.  Well, my horoscope said &quot;Many key policies will be implemented,&quot; not all of them.  Besides, it says to expect a turnabout in my favor.  Mom will relent next time for sure.  Hobbes:  What are your other key policies then?  Calvin:  No baths, stay up late, don&#39;t go to school...these are the ones that will be implemented.  Hobbes:  Maybe the astrologer was looking through the wrong end of the telescope.  Calvin:  C&#39;mon moon, do your stuff!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/23deacc0df8e01317256005056a9545d|297|900|Mom:  I thought I told you to take your bath.  Calvin:  Sorry, mom.  You have no say in this.  Mom:  You&#39;re in for a surprise, buster.  Calvin:  Circumstances are going to turn in my favor!  That&#39;s what my horoscope says!  All human affairs are determined by stars and planets, and today they say my key policies will be implemented.  That means no bath and no bedtime!  By golly, it&#39;s not good to thwart the intentions of the universe!  Hobbes:  Fate just isn&#39;t what it used to be.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2582e6a0df8e01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  I don&#39;t understand this!  Not a single part of my horoscope came true!  My policies weren&#39;t implemented and circumstances didn&#39;t turn in my favor!  Just the opposite, in fact!  What went wrong?!  I thought this stuff was based on planets and stars!  How could those be misread?  What kind of science is this?!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m sure any scientist would give you a categorical answer.  Calvin:  Maybe tomorrow&#39;s horoscope will run a correction and apology.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2724abc0df8e01317256005056a9545d|292|900|Calvin:  Did today&#39;s horoscope print a retraction of yesterday&#39;s prediction?  Hobbes:  No, there&#39;s just a new one for today.  Calvin:  What&#39;s it say?  Hobbes:  Yours says, &quot;Popularity zooms upward.  New encounters pay big dividends.&quot;  Calvin:  Hmm, that&#39;s good.  Hobbes:  Wait, it goes on.  &quot;Emphasize romance.  Opposite sex finds you irresistible.  Lucky day for love.&quot;  I bet I know what the big dividends are!  Woo woo woo!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5ebaf680784b01302116001dd8b71c47|620|900|Calvin: Isn&#39;t it strange that evolution would give us a sense of humor?  When you think about it, it&#39;s weird that we have a physiological response to absurdity. We laugh at nonsense. We like it. We think it&#39;s funny. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s odd that we appreciate absurdity? Why would we develop that way? How does it benefit us? Hobbes: I suppose if we couldn&#39;t laugh at things that don&#39;t make sense, we couldn&#39;t react to a lot of life.  Calvin: I can&#39;t tell if that&#39;s funny or really scary.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/28cfb710df8e01317256005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Don&#39;t make me go to school!  Please don&#39;t make me!  Help!  Leggo!  Ow!  Stop!  You don&#39;t understand!  My horoscope says I&#39;m irresistible to girls today!  I&#39;m too popular!  I&#39;m going to get big dividends!  Augghhh!  What if Susie kisses me?!  I don&#39;t want romance!  I hate Susie!  Call me in sick!  Help!  Mom:  Dear, I got him!  Grab his feet while I pry his fingers loose!  CAlvin:  Puh-leeze!!  Dad:  I wonder what it would cost to rent a place in town.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2ab05650df8e01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  Maybe today&#39;s horoscope won&#39;t come true.  I don&#39;t want a lucky day for love!  Hobbes:  &quot;Opposite sex finds you irresistible.&quot;  Hee hee hee!  Calvin:  I don&#39;t believe in astrology any more!  It&#39;s all phony!  Yeah, that&#39;s right!  Hobbes:  Muchas smooches!  Mm-mm!  Yow wow!  Calvin:  Stop it!  Yesterday&#39;s prediction didn&#39;t come true, so I&#39;m sure today&#39;s won&#39;t either!  I&#39;m not worried!  Hobbes:  When&#39;s the wedding??  Should I wear my spats??  Calvin:  In a minute you&#39;ll be wearing a body cast!  Hobbes:  Try it, lover boy!  We&#39;ll see how you kiss girls with a fat lip!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2c757850df8e01317256005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Take it back!  I&#39;m never getting married!  Never!  Hobbes:  Love &#39;em and leave &#39;em, eh?  You rake!  Calvin:  That does it!  I&#39;m gonna knock you into next week!  Hobbes:  Wait!  Susie&#39;s coming!  Calvin:  What?  She is?  Augh!  She is!  I&#39;ve got to discourage romance!  Hobbes:  You can&#39;t!  Smoldering passion is your fate!  Susie Derkins:  Gosh, Calvin, the dirt covering your features is a big improvement.  Calvin:  Oh no, it&#39;s true!  I&#39;m a love magnet!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2e32a230df8e01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  Stay away, Susie!  I don&#39;t want any big dividends, got it?  Don&#39;t listen to Hobbes!  Susie Derkins:  What?  Calvin:  The stars and planets are dong this!  I can&#39;t help it!  My aura is uncontrollable!  Susie Derkins:  What?  Calvin:  It&#39;s the bus!  The bus is here!  Wheee!  I&#39;m safe!  You can&#39;t do anything now!  Ha ha!  I&#39;m off to school!  Hoorayy!  Susie Derkins:  What?  The way Calvin&#39;s brain is wired, you can almost hear the fuses blowing.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2fffbff0df8e01317256005056a9545d|293|900|Hobbes:  So Susie didn&#39;t kiss you today?  Calvin:  Nope!  In fact, after I put a worm in her hair, she knocked me down and kicked me in the shins!  Hobbes:  That doesn&#39;t sound like zooming popularity.  Calvin:  Nope!  My horoscope was completely wrong again!  The planets obviously have no influence on me!  What a relief to know my life isn&#39;t controlled by outside forces!  I&#39;m the master of my own fate!  Hobbes:  ...To a point, of course.  Calvin:  The paper should print Mom&#39;s daily predictions.  Those sure come true.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/31d147e0df8e01317256005056a9545d|297|900|Calvin:  I&#39;ve been thinking about this astrology stuff.  Everyone want to know what the future holds, but you just have to wait &#39;til it happens.  So really, the best preparation for the future is to take the present and  Whoop!  Aaughh!  Hobbes: ...Think about what you&#39;re doing?  Calvin:  No, get yourself a good luck charm.  Man, here comes another bath!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/641ede50784b01302116001dd8b71c47|627|900|Calvin: Oh no! Look at poor Calvin!What&#39;s gone wrong?  He&#39;s a crude black outline barely containing garish color! What a horrible fate! His eyes don&#39;t even point the same direction! Each eye sees a different view! His nostrils are on the front of his nose like a pig! His ears are just flaps on his head! And what&#39;s this stuff on top? Is that supposed to be hair?!  Aaughh!  Calvin&#39;s hand are balls with sticks in them! He doesn&#39;t even have the right number of fingers! Where are his thumbs??  And his feet!  They aren&#39;t the same size! They face out sideways! How can Calvin stand up? Who knows? Look at his moronic expression! His face reveals no spark of intelligence! Calvin is devoid of reality and substance! How can he be saved??  What can be done??  Here we go! Ha ha! Rrrrrgghh!  I hate drawing! What a waste of time!  Hobbes: Gee, it was getting pretty good at the end.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/33692520df8e01317256005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Hey Mom, can I get some plastic surgery?  All the celebrities do it!  Mom:  Honey, celebrities need the fat sucked out of their brains, not their bottoms.  What on Earth do you want changed?  You&#39;re fine the way you are!  Calvin:  I want another eye put in my forehead.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/35298780df8e01317256005056a9545d|302|900|Calvin:  I think we need a new policy in this house.  Dad:  And what&#39;s that?  Calvin:  From now on, whenever you tell me things, I don&#39;t want to hear any reasons, explanations, subtlety or context.  I just want ten-second sound bites, ok?  So much for that policy.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|29|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/29|https://assets.amuniversal.com/36e95bf0df8e01317256005056a9545d|292|900|Calvin:  For school, we&#39;re supposed to write a paragraph about what our dads do.  Hobbes:  &quot;Dad:  The paragraph.&quot;  Calvin:  Catchy title, huh?  Hobbes:  &quot;What does my dad do?  Mostly, he gets on my nerves.  The end.&quot;  You may get a point for succinctness.  Calvin:  Well what else is there to say?!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|4|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/04/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/38a317d0df8e01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  Bad news, dad.  The character issue is killing you in the polls.  Dad:  What character issue?!  I&#39;ve got great character up to here!  Calvin:  That&#39;s what we hate.  Dad:  My only flaw is a preternatural intolerance of pesky kids.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3a4216e0df8e01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  Paul Gauguin asked, &quot;Whence do we come?  What are we?  Where are we going?&quot;  Well, I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I came from my room, I&#39;m a kid with big plans, and I&#39;m going outside!  See ya later!  Say, who the heck is Paul Gauguin anyway?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3c1655c0df8e01317256005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Look at this, Dad!  I&#39;ve got five dollars in here!  I&#39;m rich!  I&#39;ve been saving my change for weeks and weeks, and look how much I&#39;ve got!  Guess what I&#39;m going to do with it!  Dad:  Open a savings account?  Calvin:  I&#39;ll bet I know why you guys don&#39;t get invited to parties.  Dad:  Every time you make a deposit, you can think, &quot;Oh boy, another two minutes at college.&quot;
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|3|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/03|https://assets.amuniversal.com/68eb2380784b01302116001dd8b71c47|623|900|Calvin: Uh oh. Stop this right now! I had big plans outside today and I don&#39;t want to see them ruined!  Hey! Are you listening?!  Stop raining! I mean it!!  Oh ho!  You want to play rough, do you?! Fine! It&#39;s man against the elements! Conscious being versus insentient nature! My wits against your force! We&#39;ll see who triumphs! Do your worst! C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s ee what you&#39;ve got! You can&#39;t crush the human spirit! On behalf of all earthly life, I defy you!!  Ha ha!  This is just a little bath! Big deal! I think I&#39;ll take off my clothes and splash around! What do you say to that?! Ow! Ow! What&#39;s with the hail?!  That&#39;s fighting dirty! No fair!!  Are you trying to kill me?! Ow! What&#39;s wrong with you?! Oh! Oh! I&#39;m going in! Ow! I quit! I quit! Mom: I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s an explanation for this, and I&#39;ll bet I don&#39;t want to hear it.  Calvin: The universe has an attitude, Mom!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|4|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/04|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3dd10180df8e01317256005056a9545d|294|900|Calvin:  My gum has lost its flavor.  When that happens, I don&#39;t spit it out.  I just add a new piece.  After a few packs, it&#39;s like chewing a big, soggy sock!  My jaws ache and I can&#39;t close my lips, so I wheeze through my open mouth and drool!  Hobbes:  An orifice is an amusing thing, all right.  Calvin:  Ith funny how you neffa thee gwown-upth do thith.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|5|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/05|https://assets.amuniversal.com/3f8acb30df8e01317256005056a9545d|296|900|Calvin:  Oh boy, the new issue of &quot;Chewing&quot;!  Hobbes:  You get a magazine?  Calvin:  Wow, this looks great!  &quot;Special sugarless gum issue - choosing an artificial sweetener that&#39;s right for you....tongue exercises for bigger bubbles...rad fashion kneepads for walking and chewing....plus an interview with Bazooka Joe!&quot;  See, it&#39;s all target marketing!  Advertisers don&#39;t waste their time on mass audiences any more.  They find your special interest and they nail you!  Hobbes:  As if advertising wasn&#39;t intrusive enough before.  Calvin:  Ooh, the &#39;92 Spearmints are out!  I gotta get to a store!
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/411bec60df8e01317256005056a9545d|290|900|Hobbes:  I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s a magazine for gum chewers.  Calvin:  Heck, there must be a dozen such magazines.  Each appeals to a different faction.  &quot;Chewing&quot; is high-gloss, literate and sophisticated.  &quot;Gum action&quot; goes for the gonzo chewers.  &quot;Chewers illustrated&quot; aims at vintage collectors, and so on!   Each one encourages you to think you belong to an elite clique, so advertisers can appeal to your ego and get you to cultivate an image that sets you apart from the crowd.  It&#39;s the divide and conquer trick.  Hobbes:  I wonder whatever happened to the melting pot.  Calvin:  There&#39;s no money in it.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|7|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/07|https://assets.amuniversal.com/42c5ed60df8e01317256005056a9545d|292|900|Calvin:  Here&#39;s an interesting article.  The top five gum brands are compared in terms of flavor retention, elasticity, bubble capacity and chewing rebound.  The computer graph shows the results, compensating for various saliva acidities.  If you know your pH, this really helps you choose the proper gum for your chewing style.  Hobbes:  What kind of nut would care about all this?!  Calvin:  Everyone!  This is hard data!  It lets you quantify your enjoyment!  Hobbes:  I thought fun was supposed to be fun.  Calvin:  Well I prefer to trust the experts.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/446ccb70df8e01317256005056a9545d|293|900|Calvin:  Here&#39;s an ad for a new gum called &quot;Hyperbubble,&quot; and it says, &quot;If you&#39;re not chewing Hyperbubble, you might as well be chewing your own cud.&quot;  Ooh, great copy!  Gosh, am I cool enough to chew Huperbubble?  Maybe I&#39;m not!  Maybe if you chew Hyperbubble, you become cool!  Or maybe if you chew it, everyone assumes you&#39;re cool, so it doesn&#39;t matter if you are or not!  What do you think?  Should I buy some?  Hobbes:  If your emotional security depends on satisfying a need you didnt&#39; have until you read the ad, go ahead.  Calvin:  I think I will!  Boy, I&#39;m glad I get this magazine!

My lunatic whims are their laws!  Ha ha ha!  Mom:  I thought I told you to gather the trash.  Calvin:  Being a parent must be nice.

Calvin:  A person can&#39;t be a doormat unless he allows himself to be one!  I refuse to budge!  I&#39;ve got to stop reading those dumb advice columns.

They&#39;re passive and unmotivated!  They lack ambition and drive!  Not me, though!  I&#39;m going to have an epic life!  I&#39;m going to wrestle the issues of the age and change the course of history!  Hobbes:  How are you going to do that?  Calvin:  I&#39;m going to sit here and wait, so opportunity will know right were to find me when it&#39;s time to change the world.  Hobbes:  I wish I&#39;d brought a book to read.  Calvin:  Nahh.  It&#39;ll be any minute now.

Miss Wormwood:  200 B.C.?!  Calvin:  &quot;Before Calvin.&quot;  That&#39;s what&#39;s important!

Once you know things, you start seeing problems everywhere...and once you see problems, you feel like you ought to try to fix them..and fixing problems always seems to require personal change.  And change means doing things that aren&#39;t fun! I say phooey to that! But if you&#39;re willfully stupid, you don&#39;t know any better, so you can keep doing whatever you like!  The secret to happiness is short-term, stupid self-interest!  Hobbes: We&#39;re heading for that cliff!  Calvin: I don&#39;t want to know about it.  Waaaaaugghhhhh!  Hobbes: I&#39;m not sure I can stand so much bliss.  Calvin: Careful!   We don&#39;t want to learn anything from this.

That way I can complain that the government doesn&#39;t represent me.  Then, when everything goes down the tubes, I can say the system doesn&#39;t work and justify my further lack of participation.  Hobbes:  An ingeniously self-fulfilling plan.  Calvin:  It&#39;s a lot more fun to blame things than to fix them.

I&#39;m supposed to think up a story, write it, and illustrate it by tomorrow!  Do I look like a novelist?!  This is impossible!  I can&#39;t tell stories!  Hobbes:  What about your explanation of the noodle incident?  Calvin:  That wasn&#39;t a story!  That was the unvarnished truth!  Hobbes:  Oh, don&#39;t be so modest.  You deserved a Pulitzer.

Calvin:  No, I&#39;m waiting for inspiration.  You can&#39;t just turn on creativity like a faucet.  You have to be in the right mood.  Hobbes:  What mood is that?  Calvin:  Last-minute panic.
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/564728b0df8e01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  If you ask me, these assignments don&#39;t teach you gow to write.  They teach you how to hate to write.  Deadlines, rules how to do it, grades...how can you be so creative when someone&#39;s breathing down your neck?  Hobbes:  I guess you should try not to think about the end result too much and just have fun with the process of creating.  Calvin:  Every time I do that, I end up in the school psychologist&#39;s office.  Hobbes:  Well, maybe not that much fun.

Hobbes:  For your story?  Calvin:  No, I though of a way I won&#39;t have to write one!  Hobbes:  Oh no.  Calvin:  Hop in the time machine, Hobbes!  We&#39;re going a few hours into the future!  I&#39;ll have finished my story by then, so we&#39;ll just pick it up and bring it back to the present!  That way, I won&#39;t have to write it!  Hobbes:  Something doesn&#39;t make sense here, and I think it&#39;s me sitting in this box.  Calvin:  Relax!  We&#39;ll be back as soon as we go.

(Get Rid of Slimy Girls) will come to order. Dictator-for-life Calvin presiding!  Hobbes: Hail Calvin and Hobbes!  Calvin: On today&#39;s agenda, we&#39;ll make a list of what girls are good for. Obviously, this will be a short meeting! Ha!  Hobbes: First tiger Hobbes will record the list for posterity!  Calvin: OK, first, girls are good for water balloon targets! Ha ha! Second, they&#39;re good for noting! Ha ha ha!  Hobbes: Hee hee, slow down!  Calvin: Number three, girls are good for colonizing Pluto! Ah ha ha! What a great list!  Hobbes: Number four: They&#39;re good for smooching! Hoo hoo!  Calvin: Number five is...What?!? Did you say smooching?? What kind of treasonous, sissy idea is that?!  Hobbes: Well, it&#39;s true.  Calvin: Ooog!  Aaack! I got the dry heaves!! You&#39;re demoted from first tiger to tiger bulk rate!  Hobbes: You can&#39;t suppress the facts! I award myself a medal of valor!  Calvin: How would you know it&#39;s a fact?! Have you been at traitor to the cause?!  Hobbes: I hae my sources! Ow! This unleaderlike behavior will be noted in the club minutes!  Calvin: Have you been smooching the enemy?!  Out with it!! Hobbes: You have! I saw it, so don&#39;t try to deny it!  Calvin: Me?! That&#39;s a filthy lie! You&#39;ll pay for this vile slander!  Hobbes: Oh yeah? Your mom kissed you right on the cheek last night, remember?  Calvin: ...oh yeah... I guess mom is a kind of girl, sort of... Hobbes: See? According to club rules, you should be excommunicated.  Calvin: OK, presidential pardons all around!  Hobbes: Agreed!  Calvin: This is such a great club!  Hobbes: We&#39;ll add an amendment saying smooching is optional if it&#39;s your mom.

Here we go!  We&#39;ll jump ahead to my bedtime and pick up my completed homework from my own future!  Then we&#39;ll return to the present and we can goof off the rest of the evening!  Here we are!  You must be the 8:30 Calvin.  Did you have a good trip?  Hobbes:  No.  Pst!  Why do you always go on these things?
Mon Jun 08 1992 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)|1992|5|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/05/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5b485bd0df8e01317256005056a9545d|295|900|Calvin:  Greetings, 8:30 Calvin and Hobbes!  I&#39;m 6:30 Calvin and this is 6:30 Hobbes!  Calvin/Hobbes:  Charmed.  Calvin:  Well, since we&#39;re you from the past, I suppose you know why we&#39;re here.  Did you do the homework?  Me??  No.  No?!  Why not??  Because two hours ago, I went to the future to get it.  Yeah, and here I am!  Where is it?!  That&#39;s what I said two hours ago!  Hobbes:  I knew this would never work.  Right as always, Hobbes.

I figured the story was already done!  How could it be done if you didn&#39;t write it?!  Obviously it had to be done before now, because it&#39;s 8:30 and I&#39;m supposed to be in bed!  Wait a minute!  If the story had been written in your past, that would mean I should&#39;ve written it!  Well why didn&#39;t you?!  Because I came to the future to pick it up when it was done!  If you hadn&#39;t screwed up my past, your future wouldn&#39;t be like this.

Let&#39;s figure this out.  I&#39;m you at 6:30 and you&#39;re me at 8:30.  Neither of us did the homework.  Right.  That means the homework should&#39;ve been done between my time and your time.  Right.  We needed to do it at 7:30.  But the 7:30 Calvin clearly didn&#39;t do it, or you&#39;d have it now at 8:30.  Yeah!  This is his fault!  That lazy little punk!  He&#39;ll get us both in trouble!  Let&#39;s go get him!

Hobbes:  We&#39;ll wait here.  All this time travel makes us queasy.  Calvin:  We&#39;ll be right back.  Off we go!  Hobbes:  This has to be the least efficient way to write a paper.  All this modern technology just makes people try to do everything at once.

Here we are, right at 7:30!  Yikes!  My past and future!  Put down that comic book and do our homework!  Yeah!  Get to work, you loafer!  Hey!  Why should I do all the work?  Either of you could do it too!  But I didn&#39;t at 6:30 and now it&#39;s 7:30.  And at 8:30 it will be too late.  You&#39;re the last chance.  Now are you gonna start writing, or do we have to pound you?  Go ahead and hit me!  My future self will be the one who hurts!  Hey!

You&#39;re right, Hobbes.  Why don&#39;t we write a story while we&#39;re waiting for them?  Yeah!  Calvin could use it for his class then.  I&#39;ll write it down and you can illustrate it!  Ok, now what should our story be about?  Calvin&#39;s not here.  Let&#39;s write about him!  Hee hee hee!  Hoo hoo!  Drawing Calvin is easy!  You just make a big mouth and add some hair!

Oh yeah?  Why not?  Because we&#39;re all the same Calvin!  In one hour, the 6:30 Calvin will be me, and in another hour, we&#39;ll both be the 8:30 Calvin!  That means you guys will have to suffer whatever you do to me.  Oh yeah.  Oops.  Whose dumb idea was this anyway?  His?  His!

Now it&#39;s 8:30 again and we&#39;re doomed.  Hobbes:  Here you go!  Hobbes and I wrote a story for you while you were gone!  Calvin:  You did??  Ha ha!  We&#39;re all done!  We can go back to 6:30 now!  Thanks, Hobbeses!  You guys are life savers!  Mom:  Calvin?  Calvin:  It&#39;s Mom!  Hurry!  Hobbes, get in!  Calvin:  We&#39;ll be you in a couple hours!  So long!  Mom:  Aren&#39;t you in bed yet?  Calvin:  Don&#39;t come in!  I&#39;m...uh...changing into my PJs!

Calvin:  Sort of.  Mom:  What do you mean, &quot;sort of&quot;?  Calvin:  Well, Hobbes helped and I had to do a lot of time traveling.  Mom:  Is your story written or not?  Calvin:  Oh, it&#39;s written.  I just haven&#39;t read it.

Hobbes:  Me??  Calvin:  This story you wrote about me is about me trying to get out of writing the story!  You made my time traveling sound like lunacy!  And the illustration!  You drew the three of me fighting!  I was the laughing-stock of the whole class!  Hobbes:  What grade did it get?  Calvin:  Um...A+.  She wrote, &quot;Very creative.  The &#39;tiger&#39; narration was a clever touch.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re finally applying yourself.&quot;  ..But even so..!!  Hobbes:  A+??  Maybe I should send this to the New Yorker.

There&#39;s more to it than brute force.  It may seem slow, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s a thinking man&#39;s game.  There&#39;s a lot of strategy to consider.

Hobbes:  Yep, I reckon we&#39;ll have to annex part o&#39; the county!  Calvin:  Mom won&#39;t let us play with guns.  Hobbes:  I get to be the zoning board!

What do you say after that?!  Calvin:  Great diaphragm control, huh?  She&#39;ll be sorry when I&#39;m a famous soloist for the orchestra.  Hobbes:  Maybe she thinks your pitch is off.

Worse still, he gets into the cookies, spreading filth and contamination everywhere! Yes, he&#39;s a disgusting menace to sanity and health! What a pest! Ha ha ha! Hobbes: What happened? Calvin: I got swatted.

Calvin:  Yeah, well go soak your head!  Hey, that&#39;ll be one dollar!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7940e290df8e01317256005056a9545d|293|900|Hobbes:  How do I know your ideas are great?  Calvin:  It says so on my sign.  Want one?  Hobbes:  I don&#39;t have a dollar.  Calvin:  No problem!  You can put 50 cents down and pay 100% interest in dime installments over the next 10 days!  Calvin:  People just don&#39;t know a great idea when they hear one.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7ae4c420df8e01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  I&#39;m having an inventory reduction sale!  Great ideas are now just a quarter!  Mom:  Ok, here.  What&#39;s your great idea?  Calvin:  Buy some more!  Mom:  I&#39;m getting another great idea right now.  Calvin:  Me too.  See ya.

The second bowl is always the best!  The pleasure of my first bowl is diminished by the anticipation of future bowls......and by the end of my third bowl, I usually feel sick.  Hobbes:  Maybe you shouldn&#39;t use chocolate milk.  Calvin:  I tried cola, but the bubbles went up my nose.

This isn&#39;t informative!  This is a sound bite!  This is entertainment!  This is sensationalism!  Fortunately, that&#39;s all I have the patience for.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/80b78030df8e01317256005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Well, let&#39;s check my calendar and see what our schedule is for today.  Today says, &quot;do nothing.&quot;  So does tomorrow, and every day after...all the way through the end of august.  Hobbes:  I like this itinerary!  Calvin:  Let&#39;s get right to it!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/929f34b0784b01302116001dd8b71c47|623|900|Calvin: I&#39;ve been reading about the beginning of the universe. They call it &quot;The Big Bang.&quot; Isn&#39;t it weird how scientists can imagine all the matter of the universe exploding out of a dot smaller than the head of a pin, but they can&#39;t come up with a more evocative name for it than &quot;The Big Bang&quot;? That&#39;s the whole problem with science. You&#39;ve got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder. Hobbes: What would you call the creation of the universe? Calvin: &quot;The HOrrendous Space Kablooie!&quot; Hobbes: Hmmm...that is better. Calvin: Almost anything would be. Hobbes: We should lobby to change that. Calvin: And I think &quot;Tyrannosaur&quot; should be changed to &quot;Monstrous Killer Death Lizard.&quot;

Want to help me make something?  Hobbes:  Do we get smocks?  I want a smock!  Calvin:  This kind of clay isn&#39;t that messy.  You don&#39;t need a smock.  Hobbes:  I want a smock!  Calvin:  Ok, ok, you can have a smock!  Hobbes:  Let&#39;s get a marker and write, &quot;Don&#39;t knock my smock, or I&#39;ll clean your clock.&quot;  Calvin:  I guess it wouldn&#39;t show if dad wore his suit coat.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/858f7e30df8e01317256005056a9545d|286|900|Hobbes:  I like my smock.  Calvin:  Good. ...Ok, I&#39;ll divide up the clay.  Here&#39;s yours.  Hobbes:  You can tell the quality of the artist by the quality of his smock.  Calvin:  Uh huh...you have to work this stuff a bit to get it soft.  Hobbes:  Actually, I just like to say smock.  Calvin:  See, just knead it like so, and then it can be modeled.  Hobbes:  Smock smock smock smock smcok smock!  Calvin:  What on earth is wrong with you?!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8794ea60df8e01317256005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  Fine art is dead, Hobbes.  Nobody understands it.  Nobody likes it.  Nobody sees it.  It&#39;s irrelevant in today&#39;s culture.  If you want to influence people, popular art is the way to go.  Mass market commercial art is the future.  Besides.  It&#39;s the only way to make serious money and that&#39;s what&#39;s important about being an artist.  Hobbes:  So what kind of sculpture are you making?  Calvin:  Please!  It&#39;s not &quot;sculpture,&quot; it&#39;s &quot;collectible figurines.&quot;
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/898d4730df8e01317256005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  See, the problem with fine art is that it&#39;s supposed to express original truths.  But who likes originality and truth?!  Nobody!  Life&#39;s hard enough without it!  Only an idiot would pay for it!  But popular art knows the customer is always right!  People want more of what they already know they like, so popular art gives it to &#39;em!  Hobbes: And how are the movie sequels this summer?  Calvin:  Great!  Man, there&#39;s nothing I hate more than paying five bucks and having to deal with some new plot.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8b6b3030df8e01317256005056a9545d|292|900|Hobbes:  There!  I made a tiger.  Calvin:  That&#39;s no good!  Who&#39;s going to buy something like that?!  It&#39;s subtle!  It&#39;s boring!  It&#39;s incomprehensible!  How will this ever appeal to the lowest common denominator?!  It&#39;s completely unadaptable to merchandising tie-ins!  Hobbes:  Who cares?  I just wanted to make it.  Calvin:  What?!  Is this some snobby, elitist, aesthetic thing?!?
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|6|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/06/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/8d73c570df8e01317256005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  Look at the dopey clay tiger Hobbes made.  Mom:  Gee Calvin, I think this is good.  Calvin:  You like it??  Where&#39;s the marketability?  Mom:  Ask Hobbes if we can put it on the coffee table.  Calvin:  but look what I made!  A hundred shrunken heads of popular cartoon characters!  Mom:  Eww, you stitched their mouths shut?!  Calvin:  Gloat now, &#39;cause some day I&#39;ll be a lot richer than you.  Hobbes:  I call it &quot;symphony in orange, no. 1.&quot;

He&#39;s sick of working all the time! He hates cooperating with all the other ants! Calvin doesn&#39;t want to labor for the benefit of the colony! He&#39;s an individual. With his own needs and desires! From now on, Calvin the ant calls his own shots! Let some other sap do the queen&#39;s bidding! Mom: IF you won&#39;t help us around the house, why should we work to feed and shelter you?? Calvin: Calvin the flea sucks the blood of his angry host in parasitic contentment!

I want to show you something.  It&#39;s a surprise, so close your eyes.  I&#39;ll be right back.  Don&#39;t move.  Oh, cover your nose so you don&#39;t smell anything, ok?  That&#39;s real important.  And all you clothes are washable, right?  Doggone it, nobody&#39;s going to be her friend if she won&#39;t trust anyone.

Hobbes:  How so?  Calvin:  Well, when you look into infinity, you realize that there are more important things than what people do all day.  Hobbes:  We spent our day looking under rokcs in the creek.  Calvin:  I mean other people.

Mom:  Sure, honey.  Calvin:  Why would it be worth four dollars a minute to talk to the telephone to goofy ladies who wear their underwear on TV commercials?  Mom:  When were you watching that?!  Calvin:  Um...it was on...uh...during my morning cartoons.  Somehow whenever I ask a question, I end up with a lot of them to answer.

It&#39;s a beautiful day out!  Go move around!  Calvin:  Hey!  It&#39;s too hot!  It&#39;s too bright!  It&#39;s too humid!  It&#39;s too buggy!  It&#39;s too real!

Hey kid! Wake uup! Hobbes: A monster! Monster: Heh heh! Splish splash splish splash splish splash. Calvin: Stop that! I know what you&#39;re up to! Hobbes: What&#39;s he doing? Calvin He&#39;s trying to make me have to go to the bathroom. Monster: Drip drip drip! Fwoosh sploosh fwoosh sploosh. Calvin: As soon as I get out of bed, he&#39;ll grab me and suck out my innards with some vile proboscis! Monster: Fwishh spilsh fwishh splish! Hobbes: That&#39;s terrible! Will they stop at nothing?! Calvin: His plan is working, too! I&#39;ll never make it till morning! Monster: Splash splash splash splash splash! Calvin: I have to go, but I can&#39;t get out of bed! What am I going to do?? Dad: The plants on this side of the house sure don&#39;t do very well.

Hobbes:  Really?  Calvin:  There was my head, huge and white, floating in the ethereal blue!  Obviously it&#39;s a sign!  Hobbes:  Of what?  Calvin:  Very peculiar high altitude winds, I guess.  Hobbes:  Science kind of takes  the fun out of the portent business.  Calvin:  You know, some sort of cumolonimbal thing.

I just called to let you know it&#39;s a perfect day outside.  Too bad you&#39;re trapped in a boring office while I&#39;m running around free with no responsibilities!  Have a good summer!  Ha ha ha!  Childhood is for spoiling adulthood.

The world would be a better place if people would stop thinking about themselves and focus on others for a change.  Hobbes:  Gee, I wonder who that might apply to.  Calvin:  Me!  Everyone should focus more on me!

All set to write my autobiography.  And I&#39;m stuck!  Hobbes:  What&#39;s the problem?  Calvin:  I can&#39;t remember the whole first half of my life!  Hobbes:  Maybe your mom knows what you did.  Calvin:  I asked her.  She said I did revolting things that are probably unpublishable.  Hobbes:  Well no wonder you suppressed the memories.  Calvin:  Maybe I was in jail!

I wonder why they don&#39;t get dizzy and barf.  Hobbes:  Maybe they do!  Calvin:  Eww, gross!  Ha ha ha! but then why would they keep flying that way?  Hobbes:  Maybe bugs like to barf!  Calvin:  Ewwww!  They would!!  Ha ha ha ha!  Blaugh!  I tell you, Hobbes, it&#39;s great to have a friend who appreciates an earnest discussion of ideas.

What then?!  Mom:  Just eat your dinner, ok?  Calvin:  Eternal consequences, that&#39;s what!

For example, I&#39;m about to stick my nose in a jar of mustard and inhale deeply!  Let&#39;s see what is&#39; like.  Whoop!!  See, whed you&#39;re oder, you dake your sinuses fo granded.

Calvin:  I can&#39;t put it down.  Hobbes:  Gripping?  Calvin:  You said it!  Hobbes:  Maybe you should wash your hands.  Calvin:  It&#39;s a peanut butter mixed with bubble gum.

Can there yet remain some villany thou hast not committed?  Calvin:  Thou dost wrong me!  Faith, I know not where I wander.  Methinks the most capricious zephyr hath more design than I.  But lo: do not detain me, for I am resolv&#39;d to quit this place forthwith.  Mom:  Ay, but hear you this, I&#39;ll soon know thy business.  Get thee gone, wastrel!  Calvin:  By my troth, I am off.  Holy schlamoly, isn&#39;t there a cop show on where they talk like real people?  Mom:  Shhh.

Hobbes:  Every issue??  Calvin:  Sure!  That way they&#39;re all collector items!  These will be worth billions of dollars some day!  Of course, they&#39;re so cheaply printed you have to preserve them in plastic bags, but it&#39;s a small investment for such a huge guaranteed return.  Hobbes:  Gosh, and I keep buying bonds.  Calvin:  Look at the great committee that drew this issue!

Make him stop!  Mom:  Um.  Calvin:  He spoils all the good parts too!  He yells out what&#39;s happening while he&#39;s reading!  He goes, &quot;oh no, Captain Steroid is getting his kidneys punched out with an I-beam! Oh gross, now he&#39;s bleeding all over the...&quot;  Mom:  Let me see this comic book.  Calvin:  Now don&#39;t you read it first!!

She doesn&#39;t realize that comic books deal with serious issues of the day.  Today&#39;s superheroes face tough moral dilemmas.  Comic books aren&#39;t just escapist fantasy.  They&#39;re sophisticated social critiques.  Hobbes:  Is Amazon Girl&#39;s super power the ability to squeeze that figure into that suit?  Calvin:  Nah, they all can do that.

Give me a boost!  Hobbes:  What&#39;s the plan?  Calvin:  We wait for Susie to walk underneath this tree and then we drop the water balloon on her!  Hobbes:  What if she doesn&#39;t walk by?  Calvin:  Then we just sit in the tree all day.  Hobbes:  I love summer.  Calvin:  The days are just packed.

Look at the grass stains on my skin.  I say, if your knees aren&#39;t green by the end of the day, you ought to seriously re-examine your life.

I will throw this water baloon at Susie Derkin&#39;s unless I receive some sigh withing the next 30 seconds that this is wrong. It is in the universe&#39;s power to stop me. I&#39;ll accept any remarkable physical happenstance as a sign I shouldn&#39;t do this. Ready?...Go! Tum te tum doo doo. ...Nothing&#39;s happening...five seconds to g! Times up! That proves it! There&#39;s no moral law! Wheee! Ha ha! Hey Susie!! Help! Help! Help! Why does the universe always give you the sign after you do it??

Dad:  Sure.  Calvin:  Which exactly are the halcyon days of my youth?  Is Saturday one?  Dad:  I believe they&#39;re awarded retroactively when you&#39;re grown up.  Calvin:  You can&#39;t identify them until then?  Dad:  halcyonity is relative.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll go ask mom.

You&#39;re blocking the breeze and you take up too much room!  Opening the window more isn&#39;t going to help!  The problem is your big, hot, furry body!  Hey!  Leggo!  I didn&#39;t mean it!  No!  I&#39;m comfortable!  Really!  And Mom can&#39;t imagine how my pajamas get so gritty.

This is the life! Dad: Outside in the fresh air. All alone...Dad:..No distractions, no irritations... Dad:..Nothing but quiet and serenity.. Dad..A chance to get a feel for the land...Dad:..The exhilaration of speed...Dad:..The opportunity to reflect on things and let the mind wander... Dad: *Sighhh* Getting out like this really makes the rat race seem ridiculous. The weekends just aren&#39;t long enough to do what&#39;s important. Dad: You know, I think I&#39;ll quit my job and ride my bicycle all the time. Mom: Ok dear, want me to call the bike shop and see if they&#39;ll sponsor your mid-life crisis? Dad: Yeah. Ask &#39;em if they&#39;ll upgrade my shifters too.

I don&#39;t have to do what you say!  Dad:  Actually, you do.  It&#39;s in your contract.  Calvin:  My contract?  What contract?  Dad:  Oh, it&#39;s a pretty standard pre-natal form.  I had power of attorney since you were just a few cells.  Paragraph two specifies your bedtime.  Calvin:  Dad says I can renegotiate when I&#39;m 18.  Hobbes:  This 7:30 bedtime will be tough to explan to your prom date.

Hobbes:  What will we do if we see one?  Calvin:  Are you kidding?  We&#39;ll scare ourselves silly and run around in circles, screaming like a bunch of loons!  Hobbes:  I look forward to when we&#39;re old enough to get our morning jolt from coffee.  Calvin:  Ahh, I&#39;ll bet that wears off quicker.

Thank you for elevating emotion, reducing thought, and stifling imagination.  Thank you for the artificiality of quick solutions and for the insidious manipulation of human desires for commercial purposes.  This bowl of lukewarm tapioca represents my brain.  I offer it in humble sacrifice.  Bestow thy flickering light forever.

Calvin:  What?  Calvin:  A little rudeness and disrespect can elevate a meaningless interaction to a battle of wills and add drama to an otherwise dull day.  Hobbes:  Oh, that&#39;s good to know.  Calvin:  If you weren&#39;t such a muttonhead, you might have thought of it yourself!  See??  You proved my point!

Yes, what exactly is the difference between a hotdog, a weiner, and a frankfurter?  What?  Whaddaya mean?!  Ok, fine!  Thanks for nothing, you fraud!!  And I&#39;ve heard the &quot;operator&quot; isn&#39;t even a surgeon!  Hobbes:  You can&#39;t trust anyone.

Animals sure are dumb to have all that fur.  Hobbes:  People sure are ugly without it.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll bet he&#39;s cranky because he&#39;s so hot.

Calvin:  The monsters under my bed kept me up all night.  Mom:  But I checked for monsters when I tucked you in...and there weren&#39;t any.  Calvin:  I know.  Mom:  Then how did they get there after I left?  Calvin:  You want me to crawl under and ask them?!

She says the monsters under my bed may need me to think about them to exist.  Her theory is that if I just don&#39;t think about them, they&#39;ll go away.  Hobbes:  ...Of course, that idea of being dragged under the bed and devoured by monsters has a way of gripping the mind.  Calvin:  And it&#39;s not like Mom and Dad go away when I stop thinking about them.

They&#39;re not going to go away, so I guess we need to find some way to live with them.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s hard to co-exist with things that want to kill you.  Calvin:  Well we&#39;ve got to do something.  Hobbes:  We are.  We&#39;re staying awake all night with the lights on.  Calvin:  I wonder if we could set fire to the bed without burning the house down.

It smells awful in here!  Why does your room stink?  Calvin:  It&#39;s because of the darn monsters under my bed!  Mom:  Calvin, I don&#39;t believe for a minute that your nighttime &quot;monsters&quot; are causing this smell.  Calvin:  But it&#39;s true.  See?  They don&#39;t eat all the garbage we throw down there to keep &#39;em quiet.

Hobbes:  Oh?  Calvin:  Being a genius, my ideas are naturally more important and interesting than other people&#39;s, so I figure the world would benefit from a record of my mental activities.  Hobbes:  How philanthropic of you.  Calvin:  Well, the world isn&#39;t going to get it cheap.  Hobbes:  So what are you writing today?  Calvin:  I couldn&#39;t really think of anything, so I&#39;m drawing some martians attacking Indianapolis.

A good shirt turns the wearer into a walking corporate billboard!  It says to the world, &quot;My identity is so wrapped up in what I buy that I paid the company to advertise its products!&quot;  Hobbes:  You&#39;d admit that?  Calvin:  Oh sure.  Endorsing products is the American way to express individuality.

Hobbes:  What?  Calvin:  The strength to change what I can, the inability to accept what I can&#39;t, and the incapacity to tell the difference.  Hobbes:  You should lead an interesting life.  Calvin:  Oh, I already do!

Dad.  Dad:  No, we don&#39;t.  Calvin:  But people across the country are watching different TV shows than we are!  If we don&#39;t all watch the same TV, what will keep our culture homogeneous?  We can&#39;t rely on monolithic networks to provide uniform national blandness anymore!  Dad:  There&#39;s still McDonald&#39;s and Wal-mart.  Calvin:  But they don&#39;t come into our homes!

Suddenly, the alien-indicator light flashes! The bizarrotron shows a 3.7 weirdness level! Our hero hits the decelerator! Watching for the alien, Spiff reflects that weirdness is nature&#39;s way of adapting life to its environment. Species are endlessly inventive in their will to survive! Zounds!! There it is! What horrible circumstances of evolution would conspire to make a creature so profoundly ugly? Our hero moves in for further examination of its hideousness! Susie: What are you looking at?! Get away from me! According to Spiffs field guide, the creature is a gurl! Spiff makes a note that the bizarrotron has been reading a bit low lately. Monster: Weirdo!

That&#39;s what I want to know!  Which party has the pro-paleontology platform plank?  They can&#39;t ignore the dinosaur vote!  If nobody panders to us, we&#39;ll throw the election!  We&#39;ll stay home!  We&#39;re disaffected, disenfranchised and discombobulated!  We single-issue activists like to have our &quot;hot buttons&quot; pushed.

The meaning of words isn&#39;t a fixed thing!  Any word can mean anything!  By giving words new meanings, ordinary english can become an exclusionary code!  Two generations can be divided by the same language!  To that end, I&#39;ll be inventing new definitions for common words, so we&#39;ll be unable to communicate.  Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s totally Spam?  It&#39;s lubricated!  Well, I&#39;m phasing.  Dad:  Marvy.  Fab.  Far out.

Calvin:  I&#39;m seeing if it&#39;s hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk.  Hobbes:  I guess it isn&#39;t.  Calvin:  Ugh, what a mess.  C&#39;mon, I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s hotter on the car dash!

Whatever happened to unbridled greed, the conspicuous consumption of wealth, and the get-ahead-by-any-means credo??  Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s all over!  I didn&#39;t get to participate!  They can&#39;t change the game before I&#39;m old enough to play!  It&#39;s not fair!  Hobbes:  The &quot;me decade&quot; left without its poster child.  Calvin:  Maybe we can declare this the &quot;Calvin decade.&quot;

My fingers are gummy, my arms are tacky where I wiped my mouth, my shirt is dripping wet, and the stick is stuck to my pocket.  I&#39;m a syrupy mess!  Who can I hug?  Hobbes:  I&#39;m sitting over here.

Mom:  In the laundry.  Wear something else.  Calvin:  I hate it when I can&#39;t gird my loins with funny animals.

Hobbes:  You do?  Calvin:  Yeah, I think it&#39;s a fallacy that taste bottoms out somewhere.  If they could find a way to aim even lower, they&#39;d make some real money.  Hobbes:  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a brilliant career ahead of you.  Calvin:  There must be a way to cram more violence into 90 minutes!

Time for bed.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not going to bed.  Mom:  Oh yes, you are.  Move it.  Calvin:  Don&#39;t be so dysfunctional, Mom.  I&#39;ve got a new entry for out list of words that get a reaction.

Calvin:  My motto is &quot;be prepared.&quot;  Hobbes:  Prepared for what?  Calvin:  One never knows.  I&#39;ve got a dart gun, five comic books, some gum, a wrench, a book on bugs, a map of Montana, an eraser, and a rock.  Hobbes:  Gee, everyone should carry a kit like this.  Calvin:  The umbrella doubles as a parachute.

This gets easier when the numbers are big.

Calvin?  Calvin:  Miss Wormwood, I&#39;m a fierce advocate of the seperation of church and state.  Nevertheless, I feel the need for spiritual guidance and comfort as I face the day&#39;s struggles.  So I was wondering if I could strip down, smear myself with paste, and set fire to this little effigy of you in a non-denominational sort of way.  Boy, what a touchy subject!

I don&#39;t wanna take a bath!  You can&#39;t make me!  Aghh!  Leggo!  Leggo!  No no no no no no no!  Put me down!  I wish I was dead!  I hate you all!  I hate everything!  Aarrgghhh!  Mom:  Whenever I hear about people trying to rediscover the &quot;child within,&quot; I want to scream.

Calvin: AAAAAaaaa. Miss Wormwood: We&#39;re studying geography! Now what state do you live in? Calvin: Denial. Miss Wormwood: ....Sighhhhh....I don&#39;t suppose I can argue with that.

I am the culmination of creation.  Hobbes:  With no tail?!  I don&#39;t think so!  Calvin:  Stop that!  My butt doesn&#39;t need aesthetic enhancement!

Hobbes:  Sure.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll sit holding this big book, looking contemplative.  Hobbes:  Why do you want a picture like that?  Calvin:  On the off-chance I decide to do something responsible with my life, I&#39;ll need to establish a fictitious childhood.

People think cameras always tell the truth.  They think the camera is a dispassionate machine that records only facts, but really, cameras lie all the time!  Select the facts and you manipulate the truth!  For example, I&#39;ve cleared off this corner of my bed.  Take a picture of me here, but crop out all the mess around me, so it looks like I keep my room tidy.  Hobbes:  Is this even legal?  Calvin:  Wait, let me comb my hair and put on a tie.

That oughta do it.  Hobbes:  You hate sports.  Calvin:  Yeah, but people believe what they see, and now we&#39;ve got a photographic document of a fake childhood ready for any future biographical needs I may have!  Pretty shrewd planning, huh?  Hobbes:  Except for one detail.  Suppose the photographer doesn&#39;t keep quiet?  Calvin:  You drive a hard bargain, flea-bait.  Hobbes:  Ooh, now Maggot-Man is about to reveal his secret identity to Amazon-Babe!

Hobbes:  You??  Yesterday you wanted a nuclear powered car that could turn into a jet with laser-guided heat-seeking missles!  Calvin:  I&#39;m a simple man with complex tastes.

Calvin:  More of a statement, really.  I just want to say that education is our most important investment in the future, and it&#39;s scandalous how little our educators are paid!  Miss Wormwood:  Ok, hands up.  Who else didn&#39;t do the homework for today?  Calvin:  Actually, I&#39;d like to see more teachers out on the streets.

Calvin:  You don&#39;t scare me, Moe.  This is just your clumsy way of coping with the fact that I&#39;m a genius and you&#39;re still struggling with the concept of walking erect.  The truth will set your teeth free.

I wish I was a tiger.  Tigers don&#39;t need to know anything.  Hobbes:  Hey!  Attacking running animals involves a lot of physics.  There&#39;s velocity, gravity and laws of motion, not to mention all the biology we have to know.  Then there&#39;s the artistic expression of it all, and a lot more!  Calvin:  Gosh, I never realized killing was so grounded in the liberal arts.  Hobbes:  My dissertation on ethics was very well received.

Hobbes:  How?  Calvin:  I&#39;ll find a profession where everyone in it is worse than me!  Hobbes:  That might take hard work.

Calvin:  I&#39;m pretty sure the assignment was optional.  Hobbes:  Denial springs eternal.  Calvin:  It&#39;s not denial.  I&#39;m just very selective about the reality I accept.

From now on, I&#39;m not going to think about anything that&#39;s unpleasant.  Hobbes:  Isn&#39;t that a pretty self-deceiving way to go through life?  Calvin:  I&#39;m not going to think about that.

It&#39;s too hard to figure out! You never know what&#39;s going on! You don&#39;t have any control over events! I prefer to have life filtered through television. That way you know events have been packaged for your convenience! I like a narrative imposed on life, so everything logically proceeds to a tidy conclusion. And if you don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening, &quot;click&#39;&quot; you change the channel and there&#39;s something different! That&#39;s how real life should be. Hobbes: &quot;Click.&quot; Oh, good, a farce!

Calvin:  I want Hamster Huey!  Dad:  Look, you know how the story goes!  You&#39;ve memorized the whole thing!  It&#39;s the same story every day!  Calvin:  I want Hamster Huey!  Wow, the story was different that time!  Hobbes:  Do you think the townsfolk will ever find Hamster Huey&#39;s head?

Mom:  You want a new friend to play with?  Calvin:  No, I want somebody small I could beat up.  Dad:  Look Honey, can we talk about that operation some other time?

Are you busy?  Dad:  Well, sort of.  Why?  Calvin:  Oh, nothing.  I was just thinking, maybe, if you had the time, you and I could do a father-son kind of project.  You know, just the two of us.  Dad:  Why of course we can!  That&#39;s more important than this!  Sure, what would you like to do?  Calvin:  You&#39;re old enough to buy firearms and explosives, right?

I wonder which muscles control that.  I can sort of clench my butt, but I don&#39;t think it could wiggle a tail.  Hmm, how strange!  I&#39;ve never really thought about butt muscles before.  Hobbes:  Some things don&#39;t need the thought people give them.

Mom:  Here, I got you a new comic book.  Why don&#39;t you just sit on the couch and I&#39;ll make you some peanut butter crackers.  Are you comfy?  Calvin:  Um, I guess so.  Mom knows everything.

Calvin: Mom won&#39;t get me a springboard so I&#39;m making my own. Now you can watch me do the highest jump into the leaf pile you ever saw. Here I go-o! Yaaaa. Hoop.  Bonk. Gaa! Wap Oof! Bop. Hobbes: Why wouldn&#39;t your mom get you a springboard? Calvin: She was afraid I&#39;d hurt myself.

Here&#39;s a piece of chalk floating around!  Pretty weird, huh?  Yes, for Show and Tell today, I, Calvin, have turned myself invisible!  Ha ha!  Now I&#39;ll take off these clothes and the next sound you hear will be my feet heading for the door!  Adios, amigos!  Lucky guess, Miss Wormwood!  Wooooooh, these pants are hovering over the class!  Ooooh!

Look at these unsolved problems.  Here&#39;s a number in mortal combat with another.  One of them is going to get subtracted, but why?  How?  What will be left of him?  If I answered these, it would kill the suspense.  It would resolve the conflict and turn intriguing possibilities into boring ol&#39; facts.  Hobbes:  I never really thought about the literary qualities of math.  Calvin:  I prefer to savor the mystery.

Miss Wormwood:  Yes, Calvin?  Calvin:  If ignorance is bliss, this lesson would appear to be a deliberate attempt on your part to deprive me of happiness, the pursuit of which is my unalienable right according to the Declaration of Independence.  I therefore assert my patriotic prerogative not to know this material.  I&#39;ll be out on the playground.  Helllpp!  Monarchists!

Yes, do you have any books on why girls are so weird?  That&#39;s what I said.  Or you might also try looking under &quot;obnoxious.&quot;  Are you serious?!  You mean there&#39;s no research on this at all??  I&#39;ll bet the library just doesn&#39;t want anyone to know.

That&#39;s good. Calvin: My throat&#39;s still kind of scratchy. I think I should stay home from school tomorrow. Mom: We&#39;ll see. You keep resting and I&#39;ll fix some soup to bring you. Calvin: OK. Hobbes: Not feeling so good?? Calvin: Yipe! I&#39;m fine! I&#39;m the picture of health! I feel great! And I know what you&#39;re thinking, you savage! By golly, if you try carrying me off to disptach, you&#39;ll be in for a big surprise! Get away from me! Mom: Here&#39;s your soup. Goodness, you&#39;re all sweaty! Le me take your temperature again. Calvin: I&#39;ll bet other people&#39;s best friends don&#39;t wait for them to get sick and weak.

Keep going!  Hobbes:  This is as far as you can throw the ball.  Calvin:  that&#39;s not true!  Hobbes:  Ok, I&#39;ll step closer.  Calvin:  It&#39;ll be the last thing you ever do, you flea feast!  Hobbes:  Oh yeah?  Let&#39;s see if you fight as badly as you throw!  Calvin:  I guess this is another incomplete.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s a good thing we don&#39;t have to fight some other team!

Two minutes ago, I was eating devilled ham, chocolate milk, grapes, and ice cream.  And now I&#39;m running around on a playground full of nausea-inducing, disorienting motion devices.  It&#39;s the one time at school I get some solitude.

Susie Derkins:  &quot;B.&quot;  Calvin:  We lift up flap &quot;B&quot; and it says, &quot;You&#39;re a mouth-breathing bag of boogers!&quot;  Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Life doesn&#39;t get much better than this.

Susie:  Didn&#39;t you hear the bell?  Recess is over.  It&#39;s time to go in.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not done yet.  It takes me more than one recess to wear myself into a state of submission.

After chewing almost $20 worth of gum, I&#39;ve collected all the cards except numbers 8 and 34.  I&#39;ll trade you any duplicate for either of those.  Susie Derkins:  I don&#39;t collect Captain Napalm bubble gum cards.  Calvin:  It must be depressing to go through life with no purpose.

Pbthp!  That was a fumble!  Aren&#39;t you going to get the ball?  Hobbes:  No, you can have it.  Calvin:  It&#39;s not much fun playing with someone who would rather tackle than win.

Calvin suddenly finds himself on his own sheet of notebook paper! Fortunately, Calvin had been doodling all morning! Here&#39;s a tank! Pleased how well it&#39;s rendered, Calvin climbs in! The blue ruled guidelines are no match fo the tank&#39;s heavy treads! Calvin roars across the page anywhere he wants! There&#39;s the school! Calvin fires directly into Miss Wormwood&#39;s classroom! Kids dive out the windows! Oh no! Miss Wormwood has come to put a stop to Calvin&#39;s fun! He fires again and again, but she&#39;s too big and mean! Miss Wormwood: Hand it over Leonardo, and see me after class. Calvin: The arts are always the first to go in public schools.

Calvin:  I did??  Gosh, I never get mail!  I wonder who sent this.  There&#39;s no return address!  In its place there&#39;s a crude human skull with X&#39;s for eyes and its tongue hanging out!  Maybe it&#39;s the I.R.S.

The return address is a skull with X-ed out eyes!  It has a local postmark, though.  So I must know the person.  Hobbes:  Oh boy, intrigue!  Calvin:  But who would send me an anonymous, weird letter like this?  Hobbes:  Maybe a girl!  Calvin:  Gaaaa!  Doesn&#39;t the post office screen anything?!  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll get you some gloves!

Hobbes:  Hurry!  Open it!  Calvin:  Ugh, what if it&#39;s some mushy poem written with a pink pen in loopy letters with the &quot;I&quot;s dotted with hearts??  I think I&#39;d puke.  No, it&#39;s cut and pasted letters from a magazine!  Hobbes:  Wow!  No handwriting to trace!  It says, &quot;coded message to follow.  A-1, B-2, etc. destroy this letter.&quot;  Calvin:  Hobbes, we&#39;re dealing with a pro!

A skull for a return address, untraceable cut-out letters, and a code key for a future message!  This is real secret agent stuff!  Whoever sent this is taking no chances on the message being traced or intercepted!  Gosh, the message must be super top secret and important!  I wonder what it could be!  I wonder when I&#39;ll find out!  Hobbes:  It&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re the patient type.  Calvin:  This is so cool I have to go to the bathroom!

It said a coded letter would follow!  Maybe it will arrive today!  I can&#39;t wait to get home and see!  I wonder what it will say?  I wonder who sent it?  I wonder why it&#39;s in code?  I&#39;ll bet I grow up to be a spy!  I&#39;m so good at figuring out what&#39;s going on!

I&#39;m home!  Did I get a letter today??  Mom:  Yes.  It&#39;s on the table.  Hobbes:  Oh boy, Hobbes, this is it!  This is the coded message!  Calvin:  Quick, let&#39;s decipher it!  Ok, the first number is 3, so that would be &quot;C&quot;.  Next is 1, so that&#39;s &quot;A&quot;.  Hobbes:  This is fun!  Calvin:  Hey!  This says, &quot;Calvin is a porridge brain!&quot;  It&#39;s...it&#39;s an insult!  Hobbes:  Some people have secret admirers.  You have a secret detractor!

What kind of depraved maniac would go to so much trouble?!  Rrrghh, I wish I knew who sent this!!  Our only clue is that the twisted fiend has too much time on his hands.

You&#39;re the one who&#39;s been sending me insults in the mail!!  I&#39;ll get you for this!  You and your sneaky codes and pasted letters and skull drawings! ..Although, really, the skull drawings were pretty cool.  Hobbes:  You can tell a good spy by his ominous logo.

I&#39;ll teach you to trick me, you big hairball!  Hobbes:  You just have no sense of humor!  Calvin:  I do too!  It&#39;s just that was a terrible, nasty, awful thing to do, and I&#39;ll never forgiv...huh?  Heyyyyy, you&#39;re right!  It is funny!  Ha ha ha! ..ok!  We&#39;re pals again!  Letter:  Susie:  you smell!  Ha ha!

The leaves are down but there&#39;s no snow. Everything is just sitting aorund waiting for winter, but nothing is happening.  C&#39;mon, what&#39;s the big hold up?!  Let&#39;s go, up there! Bring on the snow! No effciency.  No Accountability. I tell you, it&#39;s a lousy way to run a universe.  Hobbes: Whatever happened to the work ethic?

It&#39;s really fun.  Hobbes:  But you&#39;re not painting in the lines and you&#39;re not using the colors that correspond to the numbers.  Calvin:  If I did that, I&#39;d get the picture they show on the box!  Hobbes:  Ah.

Calvin:  You like what it says on the back of my head?  Mom:  What what says?  Calvin:  Didn&#39;t the barber shave, &quot;I may have a bad haircut.  But you&#39;re downright ugly,&quot; back there?!  Mom:  Good heavens, no!  Calvin:  Ok, Charlie, gimme back that tip!

The brisk air, the smell of leaves...all ruined because I have to get on a bus and go to school.  When I was a pre-schooler, I never took advantage of all mornings.  I didn&#39;t appreciate them.  Hobbes:  Another squandered youth.  Calvin:  Sighhh...I was so young and foolish.  I thought those days would last forever.

Sure, I&#39;d be glad to take a message.  You write it down, drive it over here, pay me five bucks, and I&#39;ll give it to her the next time I see her.  He must not have wanted to talk to mom very bad.

Then I&#39;ll file them into points, so I&#39;ll have claws just like you.  Hobbes:  Mine are retractable.  Calvin:  No retractable claws, no opposable toes, no prehensile tail, no compound eyes, no fangs, no wings...Sighhh...

Mom:  Why don&#39;t you just play &quot;chicken&quot; on the railroad tracks?  It would be a cheaper way to toy with death, I&#39;m sure.  Calvin:  Mom&#39;s so pratical.

Look at this.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s a duck.  Calvin:  I know!  Who wants to draw a duck?!  I sure didn&#39;t!  They made me!  I&#39;ve been manipulated!  My natural artistic talent has been used against my will to create some corporate entity&#39;s  crude idea of waterfowl!  It&#39;s outrageous!  Hobbes:  Another blow to creative integrity.  Calvin:  From now on, I&#39;ll connect the dots my own way.

My dad says when he was in school, they taught him to do math on a slide rule.  He says he hasn&#39;t used a slide rule since, because he got a five-buck calculator that can do more functions than he could figure out if his life depended on it.  Given the pace of technology, I propose we leave math to the machines and go play outside.  My bills always die in subcommittee.

Dad:  Well, let&#39;s say you want 25 dollars.  You punch in the amount...and behind the machine there&#39;s a guy with a printing press who makes the money and sticks it out this slot.   Calvin:  Sort of like the guy who lives up in our garage and opens the door?  Dad:  Exactly.

Miss Wormwood:  Yes, Calvin?  Calvin:  You can present the material, but you can&#39;t make me care.  Rumor has it she&#39;s up to two packs a day, unfiltered.

Why don&#39;t superheroes go after more subtle, realistic bad guys?  Hobbes:  Yeah, the superhero could attend council meetings and write letters to the editor, and stuff.  Calvin:  Hmm...I think I see the problem.  Hobbes:  &quot;Quick!  To the bat-fax!&quot;

A School day break for play and exercise. Little does Susie realize how much exercise she is about to get! She turns at the sound of running feet behind her. Have her friends come to join her? No! It&#39;s a pack of ferocious deinonychus dinosaurs!! Screaming, Susie hurls herself toward the school doors, but the pack is closing in! With the grim efficiency of wild dogs, the predators have a meal. Across the playground, students huddle in stupefied horror! Which one of them will be next? Thus the weak and stupid are weeded out in a heartless, but essential, natural selection, keeping the human population in check. At least, that&#39;s how it ought to be. Miss Wormwood: Thank you for that tastelss and entirely uninformative report on overpopulation. See me after class. Calvin: You like that, Susie??

Susie:  Heck no!  Calvin:  Why not?  Susie:  Because you&#39;d get a good grade without doing any work.  Calvin:  So?  Susie:  So it&#39;s wrong to get rewards you haven&#39;t earned.  Calvin:  I&#39;ve never heard of anyone who couldn&#39;t live with that.

But I&#39;ll tell you that, when I&#39;m at school, my mom puts on a patriotic leotard, a cape, and knee-high, high-heeled boots, and she fights crime as a super heroine.  I hope you&#39;re all duly impressed.  Thank you very much.  Mom:  That&#39;s the note his teacher sent home with him.  Dad:  Wow, show me that outfit sometime.

Susie:  It&#39;s gotta be better than the alternative.  Calvin:  What&#39;s it like?  Is it like being a bug?  Susie:  Like a what?!  Calvin:  I imagine bugs and girls have a dim perception that nature played a cruel trick on them, but they lack the intelligence to really comprehend the magnitude of it.  I must&#39;ve put my finger on it.

Dad:  If I were, you can bet I&#39;d be re-evaluating my strategy.  Calvin:  Mom, dad keeps insulting me.

Here&#39;s a nice one.  See how smooth it is?  It probably took eons to get like this.  It&#39;s a sedimentary rock, formed by sediment deposits, as opposed to, say, an igneous rock, which is volcanic in origin.  Hobbes:  You sure know a lot about rocks.  Calvin:  You bet.  Ballistic missiles from God, I call &#39;em.

I just want love and peace for my fellow man.  Reverse psychology.  Hobbes:  Kind of risky, don&#39;t you think?

I&#39;m guessing cheap elf labor, lower environmental standards, and tax breaks.  Is this really the example you want to set for us impressionable kids?  My plan is to put him on the defensive before he considers how good I&#39;ve been.

Instead, I got socks and a shirt.  Obviously, you mixed up my order with someone else&#39;s.  Let&#39;s get with the program, huh?  Just because he gives the stuff away free, he thinks he can get away with an incompetent organization.

I&#39;d sure like to paste someone upside the head with it....but I figure each snowball I throw means I&#39;ll get one less present from Santa.  I wish I knew if Santa was bringing me any underwear.

They have snow-making machines that can cover a whole hillside.  Hint, hint.  Dad:  You can rely on the weather like every other kid.

How touching to have the meaning of Christmas brought to us by cola, fast food, and beer conglomerates.  Who&#39;d have ever guessed product consumption, popular entertainment, and spirituality would mix so harmoniously.  It&#39;s a beautiful world, all right.  Calvin:  Dad doesn&#39;t handle the season&#39;s stress very gracefully.

Dad:  Um, ok...  Calvin:  As the wage earner here, it&#39;s your responsibility to show some consumer confidence and start buying things that will get the economy going and create profits and employment.  Here&#39;s a list of some big-ticket items I&#39;d like for Christmas.  I hope I can trust you to do what&#39;s right for our country.  Dad:  I&#39;ve got to stop leaving the Wall Street Journal around.

Hobbes:  Why?  You don&#39;t shop for anyone, you&#39;ve got two weeks off from school, and your parents do all the cooking, cleaning, and decorating!  How could you have holiday stress?  Calvin:  Deep down, I doubt my greed for presents can overcome my desire to misbehave.

Hobbes:  Yeah?  Calvin:  If I do ten spontaneous acts of good will a day from now until Christmas, Santa will have to be lenient in judging the rest of this last year!  I can claim I&#39;ve turned a new leaf!  Hobbes:  Ten spontaneous acts of good will a day?  That&#39;s pretty many.  Calvin:  Don&#39;t remind me.  Hobbes:  Well, here&#39;s your chance.  Susie&#39;s coming this way.  Calvin:  Maybe I&#39;ll start tomorrow and do 20 a day.

It&#39;s a clear shot!  I can&#39;t miss!  Hobbes:  I thought you were going to do ten spontaneous acts of good will a day.  Calvin:  It&#39;s not even noon.  I&#39;ll do &#39;em after lunch.  Hobbes:  Look, doing ten good acts isn&#39;t going to impress Santa if you do bad things all morning!  Calvin:  Suppose I just graze her jaw and knock some fillings loose.  That would be in the gray area, don&#39;t you think?  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t expect to play with all my presents when you don&#39;t get any.

Calvin: For example, how much does he weigh motives? Does he consider the kid&#39;s natural predisposition? Calvin: I mean, if some sickeningly wholesome nerd likes being good, it&#39;s easy for him to meet the standards! There&#39;s no challenge! Calvin: Heck, anyone can be good if he wants to be! The true test of one&#39;s mettle is being good when one has an innate inclination towards evil. Calvin: I think one good act by me, even if it&#39;s just to get presents, should count as five good acts by some sweet-tempered kid motivated by the pureness of his heart, don&#39;t you?Hobbes: Of course, in your case, the question is academic. Hobbes: I wanted to put a rock in the snowball, but I didn&#39;t. That should be worth a lot!

I&#39;m sorry!  Susie:  Not as sorry as you&#39;re going to be!  Calvin:  I think as long as you suffer for your sins, they don&#39;t count.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s your only hope.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/90efc8c0df8f01317256005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  Here!  It&#39;s a comic book!  It&#39;s my comic book, but you can read it.  Just make sure your hands are clean and acid-free, and only touch the mylar bag, and use these sterilized tongs to turn the pages, and try not to exhale too much moisture, ok?!  Don&#39;t mess it up!  There!  That&#39;s one spontaneous act of good will!  I hope you&#39;re satisfied, Santa, darn you!!  Hobbes:  I think spontaneous acts of good will should be less reluctant.  Calvin:  Reluctant ones qualify!!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/92948740df8f01317256005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Ullkkk...mom, I&#39;m guessing this is boiled guano on raw maggots, but I&#39;m (orrg) choking it down as best as my cramping stomach allows.  This is another spontaneous act of good will, Santa!  You&#39;d better come through in spades for this!!  Mom:  More maggots?  Calvin:  Sure!  Pile &#39;em on!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/94397390df8f01317256005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  One more day of being good!  This has been the longest week of my entire life.  Hey!  I&#39;ll bet Santa&#39;s loading up the sleigh right now!  He&#39;s got millions of deliveries, right?  He couldn&#39;t possibly still be deciding how good I am!  If his decision is made, I don&#39;t have to impress him any more!  I&#39;m free!  The charade is over!  I can do what I want!  Hobbes:  Maybe he&#39;s loading your stuff last, just to see what you do.  Calvin:  You think?  Well, maybe.  Geez, he&#39;s a tough ol&#39; geezer!  Well, what&#39;s one more day?...sigh...
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/95e4d280df8f01317256005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  It&#39;s a certificate entitling the bearer to one day pounce-free of tiger attacks!  Wow!  Thanks, ol&#39; buddy!  You always think of the best gifts!  Dad:  I still think this could&#39;ve waited until sunrise.  Mom:  Shh, take a picture.

And it&#39;s not wet enough to pack, either.  Sighhh.  Fortunately, I&#39;m the stoic type.  Hobbes:  You&#39;re an inspiration to us all.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/1fff9190784c01302116001dd8b71c47|618|900|Calvin: Everybody makes the wrong kind of New Year&#39;s resolution. All they do is promise to stop bad habits and start good habits.  Hobbes: What&#39;s wrong with that? Calvin: It&#39;s not enough to change a few little habits! Everybody I know needs a complete personality overhaul! That&#39;s why I&#39;ll be spending the remaining days of this year telling people what I hate about them and how they should change.  Hobbes: Some of us would be happy to reciprocate.  Calvin: Sorry. My New Year&#39;s resolution is not to change a bit.

Dad:  Such as?  Calvin:  Well, just for starters, there&#39;s...that is, hypothetically, I mean...not that I&#39;d know for a fact, of course...just in theory, I imagine that maybe...um, well, gosh, it&#39;s hard to say.  I&#39;ve got to stop introducing topics of conversation.

Hobbes:  Um...  Calvin:  There&#39;s no toll-free customer service hot line for complaints!  That&#39;s why things don&#39;t get fixed!  If the universe had any decent management, we&#39;d get a full refund if we weren&#39;t completely satisfied!  Hobbes:  But the place is free.  Calvin:  See, that&#39;s another thing.  They should have a cover charge and keep out the riffraff.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/9c897460df8f01317256005056a9545d|286|900|Calvin:  Do you need nails pounded into anything?  You name the surface and I&#39;ll fill it full of nails!  Mom:  Um, no...  Calvin:  You sure?  I&#39;ve got the tools right here!  Lots of nail sizes!  I&#39;d be happy to do it!  Mom:  No thanks, not today.  Calvin:  Ok, well, let me know if you change your mind.  Mom:  Mm-hmm.  Calvin:  Mom wanted a girl.  I just know it.  Hobbes:  Did she need anything sawed?
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1992|12|31|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/12/31|https://assets.amuniversal.com/9e33a710df8f01317256005056a9545d|292|900|Calvin:  People always seem so crabby and animals always seem so content.  I wonder why that is.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s probably because animals know they&#39;re superior and people know they&#39;re inferior.  Calvin:  I figured it was because animals get 15 hours of sleep every day.  Actually, I think animals are just as crabby as people are.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5582c3c0df950131725e005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Wow, look at the snow coming down!  The roads are a mess!  I hope dad makes it home ok.  Calvin:  Face it, dad, the season&#39;s over.  Dad:  Are you kidding?  In this stuff, I reach my optimal heart rate in no time!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/56c49880df950131725e005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  I&#39;ve decided to stop caring about things.  If you care, you just get disappointed all the time.  If you don&#39;t care, nothing matters, so you&#39;re never upset.  From now on, my rallying cry is, &quot;So what?!&quot;  Hobbes:  That&#39;s a tough cry to rally around.  Calvin:  So what?!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|3|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/03|https://assets.amuniversal.com/24a5da40784c01302116001dd8b71c47|609|900|Calvin: It&#39;s a new year...A new beginning! New Possibilities! THis snowman represents the spirit of the new year. Looking ahead, he strives forward with confidence and determination! He challenges! He imagines! He invents! He calls forth the best qualities of human drive and ingenuity! Hobbes: very inspiring.  Calvin: Thank you. Hobbes: And over here is the real world?  Calvin: Right. This is why we&#39;re always glad when the old year is over.

Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|5|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/05|https://assets.amuniversal.com/59485d70df950131725e005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  I don&#39;t want to go to school.  I don&#39;t want to know anything new.  I already know more than I want to!  I liked things better when I didn&#39;t understand them!  The fact is, I&#39;m being educated against my will!  My rights are being trampled!  Hobbes:  Is it a right to remain ignorant?  Calvin:  I don&#39;t know, but I refuse to find out!
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5ad53680df950131725e005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin:  It would sure be a big surprise if the school bus spontaneously exploded and I didn&#39;t have to go to school!  Yeah, I&#39;d sure be surprised if that happened!  Life is full of surprises, but never when you need one.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|7|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/07|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5c3a7b50df950131725e005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  I&#39;m ho-ome!  Hello??  Thanks for the big welcome!  Hobbes:  You&#39;re letting in cold air.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5d859c90df950131725e005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Problems often look overwhelming at first.  The secret is to break problems into small, manageable chunks.  If you deal with those, you&#39;re done before you know it.  For example, I&#39;m supposed to read this entire history chapter.  It looks impossible, so I break the problem down.  Hobbes:  You focus on reading the first section?  Calvin:  I ask myself, &quot;Do I even care?&quot;
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|9|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/09|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5ec74b80df950131725e005056a9545d|285|900|Hobbes:  Whatcha doin&#39;?  Calvin:  I&#39;m killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness.  Hobbes:  I hope you&#39;re comfy.  Calvin:  You could get me something to eat.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/291e8e70784c01302116001dd8b71c47|618|900|Calvin: This is my latest snow sculpture. Hobbes: Where? Calvin: All of this!  Hobbes: But you didn&#39;t do anything. Calvin: Right. Art is dead! There&#39;s nothing left to say. Style is exhausted and content is pointless.  Art has no purpose. All that&#39;s left is commodity marketing. Consequently, I&#39;m signing this landscape and you can own if for a million dollars. Hobbes: Sorry...it does&#39;t match my furniture.  The problem with being avant-garde is knowing who&#39;s putting on who.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/6009b6d0df950131725e005056a9545d|287|900|Hobbes:  This snowman doesn&#39;t look very happy.  Calvin:  He&#39;s not.  He knows it&#39;s just a matter of time before he melts.  The sun ignores his entreaties.  He feels his existence is meaningless.  Hobbes:  Is it?  Calvin:  Nope.  He&#39;s about to buy a big screen TV.

Susie:  It&#39;s a snow woman.  Mom:  I don&#39;t care.  We&#39;re not having an anatomically correct snowman in the front yard.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/6513b4d0df950131725e005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  I hate trudging up these hills.  I didn&#39;t come out here to work!  I came out here to ride and have fun!  Hobbes:  Well, you can&#39;t ride the sled if you don&#39;t climb the hills.  Calvin:  I could if you pulled me up.  He&#39;s so lazy and selfish.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/66522760df950131725e005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin:  Ha ha!  I&#39;d sure like to see mom make me come inside now!  With this fort and this arsenal of 200 snowballs, nobody can tell me what to do!  I can stay out here all day!  At last, I&#39;m the master of my fate!  I&#39;ll stay outside as long as I please!  Mom:  Back inside so soon?  Calvin:  It&#39;s too cold out.
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/2d87f290784c01302116001dd8b71c47|610|900|Calvin: We&#39;ve been out here half an hour and nobody&#39;s attacked our fort. We don&#39;t have enough enemies, that&#39;s our problem. Hobbes: We&#39;re just too darn popular. Calvin: Yeah, everybody likes us because we&#39;re so great.  Hobbes: It&#39;s true. Calvin: And of course, I&#39;m a genius, so people are naturally drawn to my fiery intellect. Their admiratioin overwhelms their envy! Hobbes: Actually, I believe jungle cats are held in higher esteem.  Whereas one can hardly take a kid out in public, tigers add panache and savoir faire to any social occasion.  Calvin: Whaddaya mean kids can&#39;t go out in public?!? At least kids don&#39;t have fleas!  Hobbes: That&#39;s only because fleas can&#39;t stand the way kids smell!

My family is dysfunctional and my parents won&#39;t empower me!  Consequently, I&#39;m not self-actualized!  My behavior is addictive functioning in a disease process of toxic codependency!  I need holistic healing and wellness before I&#39;ll accept any responsibility for my actions!  Hobbes:  One of us needs to stick his head in a bucket of ice water.  Calvin:  I love the culture of victimhood.

Calvin:  He&#39;s contemplating snowman evolution.  Obviously, if he evolved from a snowball, it raises tough theological questions for him.  Hobbes:  Like the morality of throwing one&#39;s precursors at someone?  Calvin:  Sure, and what about shoveling one&#39;s genetic material off the walk?
Sun Apr 04 1993 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|1|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/6df46080df950131725e005056a9545d|285|900|Hobbes:  It&#39;s that moment of dawning comprehension I live for.

Hobbes:  What?  Calvin:  I take nouns and adjectives and use them as verbs.  Remember when &quot;access&quot; was a thing?  Now it&#39;s something you do.  It got verbed.  Verbing weirds language.  Hobbes:  Maybe we can eventually make language a complete impediment to understanding.

I love it before it&#39;s cooked!  Can I have some?  Please, please?  Mom:  No, it&#39;s got raw eggs in it and you could get salmonella poisoning.  Calvin:  One more nostalgic part of childhood goes THBPPTH.

I thought they were right here.  Hmm...I put them down...I went to get my book...I told Calvin to shovel the walk...where could they be??

Hobbes:  So they melt faster?  Calvin:  No.  So you can fit in 40 or 50 of them.  This way, the hot chocolate just fills in the cracks.  Hobbes:  I wondered why you eat it with a fork.  Calvin:  Also, I don&#39;t use milk.  I just heat the syrup.

What is it?  Calvin: I&#39;ts dog food. And don&#39;t call me &quot;honey.&quot; Susie: You can&#39;t feed me dog food!  I&#39;m the President of the United States! Calvin: No, you&#39;re the president of deluded fruitcakes anonymous! Give me a break! Susie: You&#39;re just mad because you&#39;re the &quot;first husband&quot; and you have to vacuum the White House all day! Calvin: I do not! In fact, I&#39;m not your husband at all! Susie: What are you doing?! Stop being such a little weirdo! Calvin: Me Monga-Taa, king of jungle! Susie: Oh, nice underpants! You&#39;re really gross.  Calvin: Me off to jungle! Find tiger friend! Live with animals! Susie: I can run the country without you! Good riddance, you moron! Calvin: It take one to know one! Boy, am I glad to see you.  Playing with Susie is a big waste of time.  You wouldn&#39;t believe the junk she can imagine. Hobbes: Nice underpants. Mom: What do you mean Calvin left his clothes with Susie??

Hang it up where it belongs!  I&#39;m not looking for extra work around here.  Calvin:  Oh, like I am.

Calvin:  Oh yeah?!  Well, you&#39;ll have to catch me first!  When your strategy is to run like a squirrel, it&#39;s hard to come up with a good taunt.

I think we might all learn a lesson from how this utterly unique and exquisite crystal...turns into an ordinary, boring molecule of water, just like every other one.  When you bring it in the classroom.  And now, while the analogy sinks in.  I&#39;ll be leaving you drips and going outside.  Miss Wormwood:  Calvin!

Then with freezing ice to spare, melt and soak through underwear!  Fly straight and true, hit hard and square!  This, oh snowball, is my prayer.  I only consecrated snowballs.

Calvin:  I&#39;m throwing people off my trail with deceptive footprints.  See, everyone will think these tracks were made by a one-legged kid going that way, and they&#39;ll be completely wrong!  Hobbes:  Who exactly is on your trail?  Calvin:  Look, it doesn&#39;t hurt to take precautions.

I realized that the purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity.  With a little practice, writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog!  Want to see my book report?  Hobbes:  &quot;The dynamics of interbeing and monological imperatives in Dick and Jane: a study in psychic transrelational gender modes.&quot;  Calvin:  Academia, here I come!

Why do we risk life and limb in a vertical free fall, when we could be safe at home by the fire? Because it is man&#39;s imdomitable nature to scare himself silly for no good reason! Hobbes: If you make it home to the fire, you can tell me how it was. Calvin: See? This is why there were never any great animal explorers!

Calvin: So what?! Who cares?! Not me! Hobbes: Who&#39;s your Valentine this year??  Calvin: Nobody! Hobbes: Is it Susie?? Calvin: No! Hobbes: I bet she is! I&#39;ll bet your heart beats faster at the sound of her name! Ahh, how you long to gaze deep into her shimmering eyes!!  Your cheeks are flushed! Your chin quivers to imagine her soft warm lips pressed against yours! Oh, to be locked for eternity in a passionate embrace with sweet, sweet Susie!  Calvin: Take it back! Hobbes: Can I be &quot;Best tiger&quot;?  Take it back!  Have you picked out a ring yet?  Take it back!  Where&#39;s the honey moon? Take it back!  Susie: Hey, Calvin! Calvin: Huh??  Susie: You jerk! This is for sending me a Valentine card with a drawing of me as a worm-eaten corpse! Hobbes: Oh hooo!  You sent her a card?? Doctor Love, paging Doctor I.M.N. Love!  Calvin: I&#39;d say we&#39;re about due for another Saint Valentien&#39;s Day massacre.

But the way I look at it, playing in the snow is a lot more important.  Out here I&#39;m learning real skills that I can apply throughout the rest of my life.  Hobbes:  Such as?  Calvin:  Procrastinating and rationalizing.

Hobbes:  An angel.  Calvin:  It must be a fallen angel!  Generally they burn up in the atmosphere, but this one apparently vaporized on impact, leaving this angel-shaped crater in the snow!  Hobbes:  There are more over there.  Calvin:  God must&#39;ve been punting angels left and right.  Hobbes:  Strange that there would be so many in Susie&#39;s front yard.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re all related to her.

It will be called &quot;The triumph of perseverance.&quot;  Hobbes:  Very inspiring.  What will it look like?  Calvin:  This.  Hobbes:  You&#39;re through?  Calvin:  I&#39;m bored.

This is the biggest snowball in the world! Ha ha! I can&#39;t wait to plaster somebody with it! Hobbes: How are you going to pick it up? Calvin: Reality continues to ruin my life. Hobbes: Maybe you could put it someplace where someone will walk into it.

C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go outside!  Hobbes:  Nobody gives the evil eye like your dad.  Calvin:  Did you see how his veins throbbed?

Calvin:  It&#39;s a severed head.  Susie:  It is not!  Don&#39;t be disgusting!  Calvin:  Fine.  Don&#39;t believe me.  Susie:  You said it would come in handy during today&#39;s test.  Calvin:  The head is an oracle.  I&#39;ll put it on my desk and it will tell me answers.  Susie:  Forget I asked!  I don&#39;t even care!  Calvin:  Soooosie is a booger braainn!  Calvin: It speaks the truth!

Calvin:  You&#39;re spoiling a great surprise for the class!  Miss Wormwood:  It would be a great surprise for me if you&#39;d just get to work.

And you are going to bed if I have to chase you all night!

Mom:  You certainly take the pleasure out of waiting for daffodils.

There&#39;s a quiz in my new issue of Chewing Magazine. &quot;Does your gum deliver? 10 questions show what you could be missing!&quot; Let&#39;s see how my gum does. &quot;1. How hard is your gum at the beginning? A) Rock-like or brittle B) Pleasantly firm C) Squishy or bendy&quot; Hmm... My gum is pretty hard at first. I&#39;ll mark &quot;A.&quot; Gosh I&#39;ve got negative five points already! I&#39;m not getting all the performance I&#39;m entitled to! Hobbes: I wonder what people knew before there were magazine quizzes.

You&#39;ve all read the chapter, so let&#39;s review. Calvin, where was the Byzantine Empire? Calvin: I&#39;ll take &quot;Outer Planets&quot; for $100.

Wake up! Come Quick! Mom: What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s the matter? Calvin: Do you think love is nothing but a biochemical reaction designed to make sure our genes get passed on? Mom: Whatever it is, it&#39;s all that&#39;s keeping me from strangling you right now. Calvin: Mom&#39;s midnight reassurances are never very reassuring.

You live with your parents and that&#39;s all you know. You grow up thinking whatever they do is &quot;normal.&quot; Dad: Aah, what a day! Up at 6:00, a 10-mile run in the sleet, and now a big bowl of plain oatmeal! How I love the crazy hedonism of weekends! Calvin: Well, maybe the word &quot;normal&quot; is too strong a word. Hobbes: I think we&#39;d know normal if we saw it.

As robot: Wizz wirp boingg wiss wirp boingg.  Parrot: Awkk! Hello! Hello! Fish: Gasp gasp  Calvin: Boy, am I glad to see you, Hobbes.  Hobbes: Another typical school day?

I don&#39;t want to wait for the bus. I don&#39;t want to go to school. I don&#39;t want to listen to the teacher. I don&#39;t want to study. I don&#39;t want any tests. I don&#39;t want any homework. Mom: How was your day? Calvin: It pitched a perfect no-hitter.

Isn&#39;t that weird?  I wonder why other animals don&#39;t wear clothes.  Hobbes:  If our naked pink butts showed, we probably would.  Calvin:  Our butts are just fine!

Mom: Are you done with your homework? Calvin: Yes. Mom: You read that whole chapter. Calvin: Let&#39;s just leace it that I&#39;m done. Mom: Back to your room, buster.

Hobbes:  That was a rotten trick.

Aaaaugh!  Mom: Sleepwalking! Dad: Nightmare! Calvin: Homicidal psycho jungle cat! Hobbes: Hee hee hee! You should&#39;ve seen the look on your face!  Calvin: If Mom and Dad cared about me at all, they&#39;d buy me some infra-red nighttime vision goggles.

Each one is a jumble of lightning quick, unrelated images and film techniques.  It duplicates the effect of rapidly flipping through channels.  It&#39;s a barrage of non-linear free association.  Hobbes:  I guess they&#39;re admitting that a 15-second commercial exceeds the American attention span by a good 14 seconds.  Calvin:  Huh?  Are you still talking about that?

Calvin: Sure. Scientists come up with great, wild theories, cut then they give them dill, unimaginative names. For example, scientists think space is full of mysterious, invisible mass, so what do they call it? &quot;Dark matter&quot;! Duhh! I tell you, there&#39;s a fortune to be made here! Hobbes: I like to say &quot;Quark&quot;! Quark, quark, quark, quark! Calvin: Instead of making an idiot of yourself, why don&#39;t you go find me some scientists?

That&#39;s saying I only did an &quot;average&quot; job! I got 7% of the answers correct, and in today&#39;s society, doing something 75% rights is outstanding! If government and industry were 75% competent, we&#39;d be ecstatic! I won&#39;t stand for this artificial standard of performance! I demand and &quot;A&quot; for this kind of work! I think it&#39;s really gross how she drinks Maalox straight from the bottle.

As one of those rare individuals destined for true greatness, this record of my thoughts and convictions will provide invaluable insight into budding genius.  Think of it!  A priceless historical document in the making!  Wow!  ...So who else should I add to my list of total jerks?  Hobbes:  Who else do you even know?

I&#39;ve got a great idea!  Don&#39;t shave next to your mouth, ok?  Let the whiskers grow about a foot long and then wax &#39;em so they stick straight out!  Then you&#39;ll look like a big cat!  Dad didn&#39;t think the firm would go for it.  Hobbes:  Preposterous!

Tiger!  Burning bright, in the forests of the night.&quot;  Blake wrote that.  Apparently the tiger was on fire.  Maybe his tail got struck by lightning or something.  Flammable felines - what a weird subject for poetry.  Hobbes:  This is why I try to sleep through most of the day.

You are late. Extra soap today, Robot Three, Mom out.  Calvin: Extra soap affirmative. Mom: Attention kitchen,  Calvin arriving in turbo chute 4. Clear receiving pad. Calvin: I&#39;ve got a moon meeting today. I&#39;ll be home for dinner if the shuttle isn&#39;t late. Mom: Clavin, you&#39;re going to be late for school! Put on your jacket!Why are you just standing there? Calvin? Calvin??  Honestly! Would you please try to stay in the present?!  Calvin: Sighhh.....

Reference desk, please.  Thank you.  Hello?  Yes, I need a book on painting theory and technique.  Specifically, I&#39;m interested in graffiti.  Is there a book that explains the proper use of materials and lists popular dirty words and slogans?  What on earth do they spend their money on over there?

The peanut butter is ruined!  You&#39;re supposed to scoop one half straight down and then dig out the other side from the bottom, so part of the top remains undisturbed until the very end!  Mom:  What on earth for?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a ritual!  You have to keep the top of the peanut butter smooth!  Mom:  Maybe you should make your own sandwiches.  Calvin:  If you can&#39;t control your peanut butter, you can&#39;t expect to control your life.  Did you cut the bread diagonally?

Aaughh!  Something&#39;s crawling down my leg!  Get it out!  ...Oh, it&#39;s just a couple of pennies.  I&#39;ve got a hole in my pocket.  *Whew*  You never know when some crazed rodent with cold feet might be running loose in your pants.  Hobbes:  Another reason not to wear &#39;em.

That they come into the world as sinners? Hobbes: No, I think they&#39;re just quick studies. Calvin: Whenever you discuss certain things with animals. You get insulted.

Calvin: That&#39;s right! Want some?  Susie: How do you justify charging 15 dollars?! Calvin: Supply and demand. Susie: Where&#39;s the demand?!  I don&#39;t see any demand! Calvin: There&#39;s lots of demand! Susie: Yeah? Calvin: Sure! As the sole stockholder in this enterprise, I demand monstrous profit on my investment! And as president and CEO of the company, I demand an exorbitant annual salary! And as my own employee, I demand a high hourly wage and all sorts of company benefits! And then there&#39;s overhead and actualy production costs! Susie: But it looks like you just threw a lemon in some sludge water! Calvin: Well, I have to cut expenses somewhere if I want to stay competitive. Susie: What if I get sick from that? Calvin: &quot;Caveat emptor&quot;  is the motto we stand behind! I&#39;d have to charge more if we followed health and environmental regulations.  Susie: You&#39;re out of your mind. I&#39;m going home to drink something else.  Calvin: I need to be subsidized.

Hobbes: Probably things like going to work, paying bills and taxes, taking responsibilities... Calvin: Wow. They don&#39;t kid around when they say &quot;For mature audiences.&quot; Hobbes: I&#39;ve never understood how those movies make any money.

Calvin: You know what I hate? I hate when I&#39;m talking and someone turns that conversation to himself. It&#39;s so rude! Why do they think I&#39;m talking?! It&#39;s so they can hear about me! Who cares what they have to say! If I start a conversation, it should stay on the subject of me! I also hate it when people look at me all bug-eyed. Hobbes: That must happen a lot.

With plumes of dense smoke trailing from the wings, the giant aircraft plummets out of control! Meanwhile, a 50 car freight train hits a penny on the rail at 80 miles an hour and jumps the tracks, dragging half a million tons of metal into the air behind it! In a freak coincidence, both the jet and the train are conversing on one spot where tectonic plates in the earth&#39;s crust have just begun to shift! That spot is the house of Farmer Brown, who at this moment, is unaware of a gas leak as he attempts to light his stove! As he strikes the match, he casually glances out the kitchen window. Calvin: His eye twitches involuntarily. Hobbes: Can&#39;t we play something else?

Hobbes:  True.  Calvin:  But it&#39;s not a hilarious world.  Hobbes:  ...Unless you like sick humor.  Calvin:  The world is probably funnier to people who don&#39;t live here.

Some people are born lucky and some people are born unlucky. Either way, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. You can&#39;t fight luck. Hobbes: We&#39;re headed for that cliff! Calvin: Yikes! Bad luck! Hobbes: Bye. Calvin: See what I mean?! You go along, minding your own business, and suddenly your luck runs out! If you&#39;re-ow-lucky what can you do? Ow! You&#39;re condemned to suffer! Ow! Hobbes: Ooh, right in the pricker bushes....Just like yesterday.  Calvin: Maybe my luck will change tomorrow.

Susie Derkins:  That&#39;s eleven years from now!  Calvin:  I figure that might give you enough time to find somebody who will.  If I&#39;d known her longer, I could&#39;ve given her more notice.

It seems to me that if I&#39;m not learning this material, you must not be a very good teacher!  Miss Wormwood/Alien:  Wogga muk gubba pum wup!  Boo!  Gop!  Calvin:  What??

Mom:  Smell it and see.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not going to smell it!  You smell it!  Mom:  Oh, for goodness&#39; sake, here.  ..It&#39;s fine.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t take chances with a product that prints the date you might expire.

For example, you know how milk comes out your nose if you laugh while drinking? Well, I&#39;m going to see what happens when I inhale milk into my nose and laugh! Susie: Idiocy is the essence of the male mind. Calvin: I&#39;m guessing it will shoot out my ears. Don&#39;t you want to see??

Ha ha! I&#39;m up! I&#39;m up! I&#39;m up! Mom: Hey! Get back in bed!  I mean it Calvin!  It&#39;s way too late for this nonsense! Calvin: Wheeee! I&#39;m gonna watch TV! Ha ha ha! Mom: Calvin, stop this! You go straight to bed! Calvin: No! Mom: You&#39;re in big trouble, young man! Calvin: You&#39;ll never catch me! Mom: Gotcha! Calvin: Waaugh! I don&#39;t wanna go to bed! I wanna stay up! Put me down! Let go!  I&#39;m not tired! Calvin: Aaaaaa!  Mom has to earn a night&#39;s respite from me.

Hobbes:  Sure.  What&#39;s it for?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a school contest.  We&#39;re supposed to do traffic safety posters.  The winner gets five bucks!  Hobbes:  Wow!  Calvin:  Think of it!  We&#39;ll be rich!  And then there&#39;s the fame and glory!  I tell you, this could be our ticket out of this two-bit dump!  Hobbes:  Sounds good.  What&#39;s our winning poster going to say?  Calvin:  That&#39;s where you come in.

Any ideas?  How about, &quot;Don&#39;t look into car headlights and freeze, because you&#39;ll either get run over or shot!&quot;  Calvin:  I&#39;ll check the statistics, but I don&#39;t think that happens to many people.  Hobbes:  There&#39;s more to this world than just people, you know.

Do you have any ideas for a slogan?  Dad:  Sure!  &quot;Cyclists have a right to the road too, you noisy, polluting, inconsiderate maniacs!  I hope gas goes up to eight bucks a gallon!&quot;  Calvin:  Thanks, Dad.  I&#39;ll go ask Mom.  Dad:  Why?  That&#39;s a great slogan!

Calvin:  Yeah, but I like my idea better.  &quot;Be careful or be roadkill!&quot;  Hobbes:  I suppose that lends itself more to your particular brand of illustration.  Calvin:  I hope I have enough cadmium red.

Hobbes:  A solid foundation of anatomical study is essential for the artist.  Calvin:  What should we spend the prize money on?  Hobbes:  Of course, technical skill alone isn&#39;t enough.  A picture needs depth of feeling.  Calvin:  I think I&#39;ll blow it all on jaw breakers and comic books.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll draw some stars to show pain and human suffering.  Calvin:  When you&#39;ve got talent like ours, the world is your oyster.

Finished!  Calvin:  Hey, that&#39;s terrific!  When we win first prize, I&#39;ll give you 25% of the winnings.  Hobbes:  What?!  I did all the drawing!  You should get 25%!  Calvin:  But it was my great idea!  We&#39;ll split 60-40.  Hobbes:  50-50.  Calvin:  Oh, all right, be selfish!  A good compromise leaves everybody mad.

Calvin:  I see you wasted your time drawing a safety poster for the school contest.  Susie:  I didn&#39;t waste my time!  Calvin:  Sure you did.  The winning entry is right here.  The prize is as good as mine.  Susie Derkins:  &quot;Be careful or be roadkill!&quot;  That&#39;s really disgusting.  Calvin:  Thank you.  Susie Derkins:  What is that all over the drawing?  Calvin:  Chunky spaghetti sauce!

Calvin:  I would!  I would!  Miss Wormwood:  All right Calvin.  Step up front.  Calvin:  Thank you!  My poster says, &quot;Be careful, or be roadkill!&quot;  Drawn in patent-pending  &quot;3-D Gore-O-Rama,&quot; this picture will actually attract flies, because the drawing is splattered with spaghetti sauce!  I can see you&#39;re all just sick about your chances of winning.

You know, we really ought to enter more contests.  I never realized how much fun it is to win!  Hobbes:  But we haven&#39;t won yet.  Calvin:  But we will.  And then everyone will know how great we are.  Hobbes:  Don&#39;t they already?  Calvin:  Oh, you know how people are.  They only recognize greatness when some authority confirms it.

Calvin:  I still can&#39;t believe it.  What a miscarriage of justice!  This contest was a joke!  Obviously the judges were biased against us from the start!  Hobbes:  Well, the important thing is that we tried our best.  Calvin:  The important thing is that we lost!  Hobbes:  Oops, I always forget the purpose of competition is to divide people into winners and losers.  Calvin:  What&#39;s the point of trying if you can&#39;t be a winner?

I think the judges were on the take and the whole thing was rigged! I want you to call the school board, have tehm declare fraud, and make them take the prize away from Susie and give it to me! Dad: Calvin, losing is a part of life. You should learn to be a good sport about it and keep things in perspective. Afterall, winning isn&#39;t everything. Calvin: Is that really what they believe on the planet you&#39;re from? Dad: You&#39;ve been watching athletic shoe ads again, haven&#39;t you?

I&#39;m interested in things that are none or my business, and I&#39;m bored by things that are important to know.  Hobbes:  The media aim to please.  Calvin:  Maybe the economy should be discussed in cheap motel rooms.

I can keep a dozen eggs in the air at once!  Notice I didn&#39;t say I could do it very long.  Hobbes:  This rug must need a thicker pad.

Is he asleep?  To be perfectly frank, he looks more as if he was creamed by a tank!

Hobbes:  Why do we want to find slugs and worms?  Calvin:  Because they&#39;re gross.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s why one avoids slugs and worms.  Calvin:  If we avoid them, we can&#39;t dare each other to eat one.  Hobbes:  Toodle-oo.  Calvin:  What&#39;s the matter with you?!  Don&#39;t you like fun?!

Do you dare me to eat this worm?? Susie: Just one? Calvin: Um... Well, yeah. Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s dusgusting? See him wriggle? Susie: Eating five a t once would be disgusting. I don&#39;t know about just one. Calvin: You want me to eat five?! Geeeez! Who&#39;d have thought disgust would be so inflationary?!

Susie Derkins:  50 cents?!  I&#39;d only pay 50 cents if you ate 50 worms.  Calvin:  That&#39;s just a penny a worm!  Susie Derkins:  Right.  I&#39;ll give you nickel to eat those five.  Calvin:  Five cents?!  What if I have to go to the hospital because of this?  Susie Derkins:  Oh, all right.  I&#39;ll throw in another nickel if you go to the hospital.  Calvin:  ..Not so fast!  First, prove you even have two nickels!

Susie Derkins:  No, you eat the worms and then I&#39;ll give you the nickel.  Calvin:  How about two cents up front and the rest upon completing the job?  Susie Derkins:  Sorry!  You don&#39;t get paid until you do the work.  Calvin:  Man, you&#39;d think the guy eating the worms would be calling the shots!  Susie Derkins:  Usually, If you&#39;re calling any shots at all, you&#39;re not eating worms.

Hobbes:  Now I&#39;m hopping backwards! Look at me! I&#39;m crawling! I&#39;m a tiny little inchworm, moving an inch at a time! Inchy-squinchy! Inchy-squinchy! Calvin: Aaieee.  Hobbes: Whoop! Too late! Home run! Mom: Stitches for Hobbes, bandages for you..how on earth did you do this to yourself? Calvin: Don&#39;t feel sorry for him! He-ow-deserved it!

Reading a new comic book.  2.  Petting a happy dog.  3.  Getting a letter in the mail.  4.  Eating the marshmallows in hot chocolate.  5.  Smiling when a big kid calls you a nasty name...and then punching his teeth straight down his ugly neck.  Hobbes:  You really pull the ol&#39; heartstrings.  Calvin:  Some of these I haven&#39;t personally experienced, sad to say.

A casual observer might even confuse the two.  But if you notice, here the colors are less intense and the people are uglier.  Also, I see that several minutes can go by without a single car chase, explosion, murder or pat personal exchange.  Hobbes:  Why settle for less, hmm?  Calvin:  Shh, this is my favorite deodorant commercial.

This volunteer social work just isn&#39;t for me.

Each card has a letter followed by several dashes.  When I show the card, you yell the vulgar, obscene or blasphemous word they stand for!  ...Ready?  She&#39;s such a hypocrite about building vocabulary.

Also, private lives are legitimate public entertainment.  And the lowest common denominator is always right!  Do I have career options or what?  Hobbes:  I think I need to start hanging around with other animals.

Ahh! Eee! It could&#39;ve happened! Mom: Only corn does that. Add some cold water and get back in the tub.

Mom:  Oh?  Calvin:  Nope!  I&#39;ve decided to be a &quot;hunter-gatherer&quot; when I grow up!  I&#39;ll be living naked in a tropical forest, subsisting on berries, grubs, and the occasional frog, and spending my free time grooming for lice!  All the experts say it&#39;s bad parenting to squelch a kid&#39;s ambitions.

Miss Wormwood:  Yes?  Calvin:  Given that, sooner or later, we&#39;re all just going to die, what&#39;s the point of learning about integers?  Miss Wormwood:  Turn to page 83, class.  Calvin:  Nobody likes us &quot;big picture&quot; people.

Eventually, we&#39;re each going to die, our species will go extinct, the sun will explode, and the universe will collapse.  Existence is not only temporary, it&#39;s pointless!  We&#39;re all doomed, and worse, nothing matters!  Hobbes:  I see why people don&#39;t like to look at the big picture.  Calvin:  Well, it puts a bad day in perspective.

Specifically, I&#39;d like to debate whether cannibalism ought to be grounds for leniency in murders, since it&#39;s less wasteful.  For some reason, they&#39;d rather teach us stuff that any fool can look up in a book.

Hobbes:  No?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a question of priorities, Hobbes.  A man&#39;s got to make room for what he cares about.  These days are precious, and I&#39;d rather spend them goofing around than studying.  Hobbes:  I never really thought of ignorance as a quality life issue.  Calvin:  Apparently, neither has Dad.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|6|5|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/06/05|https://assets.amuniversal.com/002d4920df960131725e005056a9545d|283|900|Calvin: You know why birds don&#39;t write their memoirs? Because birds don&#39;t lead epic lives, that&#39;s why! Who&#39;d want to read what a bird does? Mobody. That&#39;s who! This is changing the subject, but have you ever noticed how somebody can say something totally loony and not be aware of it? What are you supposed to do, just let it slide?? Hobbes: Sometimes if you wait, he&#39;ll top himself. Calvin: I say just punch &#39;im then and there!
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|6|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/06/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/97650070784c01302116001dd8b71c47|625|900|Hobbes: Whatcha doin&#39;? Calvin: Getting rich! Hobbes: Really? Calvin: Yep. I&#39;m writing a self-help book! There&#39;s a huge market for this stuff. First, you convince people there&#39;s something wrong with them. That&#39;s easy because advertising has already conditioned people to feel insecure about their weight, looks, social status, sex appeal, and so on.  Next, you convice them that the probelm is not their fault and that they&#39;re victims of larger forces. That&#39;s easy, because it&#39;s what people believe anyway. Nobody wants to be responsible for his own situation. Finally, you convince them that with your expert advice and encouragement, they can conquer their problem and be happy! Hobbes: Ingenious. What problem will you help people solve? Calvin: Their addiction to self-help books! My book is called, &quot;Shut Up and Stop Whining: How To Do Something With Your Life Besides Think About Yourself.&quot;  Hobbes: You should probably wait for the advance before you buy anything. Calvin: the trouble is...if my program works, I won&#39;t be able to write a sequel.

Hobbes:  Sure!  Calvin:  Ok, this guy goes into a bar.  No, wait, he doesn&#39;t do that yet.  Or maybe it&#39;s a grocery store.  Ok, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Let&#39;s say it&#39;s a bar.  He&#39;s somewhere in the vicinity of a bar, right?  So anyway, there&#39;s this dog and he says something odd, I don&#39;t remember, but this other guy says, um, well, I forget, but it was funny.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll try to imagine it.  Calvin:  Yeah, you&#39;ll really laugh.

Person on phone:  Hello.  Is your mother home?  Calvin:  What business is it of yours, jerk?!  Some people sure are nosy.  Mom:  I left three messages today, and nobody returned my call.  Calvin:  How rude.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|6|10|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/06/10|https://assets.amuniversal.com/054a2a40df960131725e005056a9545d|288|900|Mom: I think we should get an answering machine. Dad: Ugh. I don&#39;t.  If you have a machine, you feel obligated to return a bunch of calls you&#39;d rather not have received in the first place.  Without a machine, you can just let the phone ring, and eventually the caller gives up and you don&#39;t have to talk to him.  Mom: That wasn&#39;t quite my point.  Dad: That&#39;s the problem at work.  The secretaries won&#39;t ignore the phone, so I&#39;m always talking to people.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|6|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/06/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/069b7500df960131725e005056a9545d|285|900|Calvin:  The more you think about things, the weirder they seem.  Take this milk.  Why do we drink cow milk??  Who was the guy who first looked at a cow and said, &quot;I think I&#39;ll drink whatever comes out of these things when I squeeze &#39;em!&quot;?  Isn&#39;t that weird?  Hobbes:  I think conversation should be kept to a minimum until afternoon.

My centering, self-actualizing anima has been impacted by toxic, co-dependant dysfunctionality! Mom: You&#39;ve been temporarily inconvenienced. Take out the trash. Calvin: Are you saying there&#39;s a difference?!

Ack, oof, umf, AAAAAA, Nng, AAAAAA. Thanks for the helmet, dad. Do they sell long range offensive weapons? Dad: Looks like you&#39;ve been building some character!

Dad:  Trees sneezing.  Calvin:  Really??  Dad:  No, but the truth is more complicated.  Calvin:  The trees are really sneezing today.

Calvin:  A bunch of suspended water and ice particles, ...why?  Everybody hates a literalist.

I think the problem lies in the mix of the phlegm. If you don&#39;t get that critical mucus mass, you just... ...Hobbes? Nobody likes to hear about a hobby.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|6|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/06/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/106e9890df960131725e005056a9545d|284|900|Calvin: You know what I like to do when someones talking to me? I stare at the persons chin. I&#39;ll nod and resopond to whatever he is saying. But I keep looking at his chin and changing my expression. I look quizzical at first, then vaguely repulsed, and leter, quietly amused. Then I&#39;ll suddenly arch my eyebrows and blink a lot, and then I look skeptical and disbelieving. You get bonus points every time the person loses his train of thought. Hobbes: I&#39;ll bet your natural charm has made you a good sprinter.

Three whole months with no responsibilities! There&#39;s nothing we have to do! Hobbes: They say idle hands are the devil&#39;s workshop. Calvin: I resent that! We work darn hard at this.

Suppose this is all we get.  Hobbes:  Oh.  What the heck.  I&#39;ll take it anyway.  Calvin:  Yeah, but if I&#39;m not going to be eternally rewarded for my behavior, I&#39;d sure like to know now.

Hobbes:  Thank you.  Calvin:  It&#39;s funny how you never see Mom and Dad practice these.  Hobbes:  They&#39;re probably good at it already.

It didn&#39;t have any violence, explosive action, or swearing.  There was nothing shocking about it at all.  Hobbes:  Did you like it?  Calvin:  It&#39;s hard to say.  Not having my emotions manipulated is such a weird experience.

It&#39;s called, &quot;Commander Coriander Salamander and &#39;er Singlehander Bellylander&quot;!  Dad:  Architects should be forced to live in the buildings they design, and children&#39;s book authors should be forced to read their stories aloud every single night of their rotten lives.

Our hero&#39;s bizarrotron indicates the presence of aliens! Spiff sets out to investigate! Crouching behind a boulder, our hero hears alien voices...talking about him! Voice from right: Blorg gablorg spiff! Ha ha! Calvin: Spiff bursts into the open, death ray blaster blasting! &quot;I&#39;ll give you something to talk about!&quot; he yells! Mom: Excuse me a moment. Calvin: Back in the darkenss of outer space, Spiff reflects on his one miscalculation. Our hero resolves to revisit the planet, this time with more ammo! Hobbes: No sleep tonight, I see.

But every time I do, they tell me to stop it.  Hobbes:  I&#39;m not sure that total self-indulgence is really a principle.

Isn&#39;t that weird??  If computers can think, what will people be better at than machines?  Hobbes:  Irrational behavior.  Calvin:  Maybe they&#39;ll invent a psychotic computer.

Try it!  Hobbes:  Why would anyone want his tongue to dry up?!  Calvin:  Because then it feels really weird when you touch it.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll take your word for it.  Calvin:  Some people just aren&#39;t open to revelatory experiences.

Ask me a question.  Hobbes:  Why does the world&#39;s most powerful computer wear little red sneakers?

Ask me a question.  Mom:  Did Calvin clean his room as I asked him to, or did he spend the whole morning playing with a cardboard box?  Calvin:  Um...system error...delete question and try again.  Hobbes:  What happened?  Calvin:  Mom booted me up here.

The world owes me happiness, fulfillment and success.  Hobbes:  Well, lucky you!  Calvin:  Yeah, I&#39;m just here to cash in.

Calvin:  Out.  Mom:  Did you pick up your room?  Calvin:  I tried, but I couldn&#39;t lift it!  Get it??  Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  For some reason, the sound of children&#39;s laughter doesn&#39;t make mom sentimental.

Dad:  Mm.  Calvin:  These summer days sure slip by, don&#39;t they?  Too bad the daily drudgery of making a living has to keep you from appreciating these sublime moments of life.  Well, best not to think about it!  If you stay healthy, you can enjoy days like this when you retire!  See you tonight!  Ahhhh, summer!

Hobbes:  What is it?  Calvin:  It&#39;s the box a bar of soap comes in.  It&#39;s a tradition that when you harangue the multitudes, you stand on a soap box.  Hobbes:  You&#39;d probably be more impressive if you tried using the soap.  Calvin:  Let me know if you see any multitudes.

I&#39;m hot, dirty, sweaty, itchy and tired.  Hobbes:  I say consider this day seized!  Calvin:  Tomorrow we&#39;ll seize the day and throttle it!

Calvin:  I dunno...I kinda figured teachers slept in coffins all summer.

Definitely not. Mmm...nahh....That&#39;s a little better. Eww. Yeah! Perfect! Mom: What now, Calvin? No. Absolutely not. Put those back. Calvin: Mom says no way. Hobbes: Grown-ups have no taste.

History is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction.  That&#39;s why events are always reinterpreted when values change.  We need new versions of history to allow for our current prejudices.  Hobbes:  So what are you writing?  Calvin:  A revisionist autobiography.

Moving.  Spiritually enriching.  Sublime. ...&quot;high&quot; art!  The comic strip.  Vapid.  Juvenile.  Commercial hack work. ...&quot;low&quot; art.  A painting of a comic strip panel.  Sophisticated irony.  Philosophically challenging. ...&quot;high&quot; art.  Hobbes:  Suppose I draw a cartoon of a painting of a comic strip?  Calvin:  Sophomoric.  Intellectually sterile. ...&quot;low&quot; art.

Hey, mom!  Mom:  Calvin, stop yelling across the house!  If you want to talk to me, walk over to the living room, where I am!  Calvin:  I stepped in dog doo.  Where&#39;s the hose?

Put a rock in his way, and he just goes around it.  Flip him on his back, and he rights himself and continues on his way.  He&#39;s focused, determined, and steadfast.  If he&#39;s mocking me, I&#39;m gonna goosh him.

It&#39;s not fair!  I&#39;ll show mom and dad, though!  They&#39;ll pay for this!  If I have to go to bed while its still light, then I&#39;m going to get up when it&#39;s still dark!

He, he must find sh-shelter!  Wait! Something is approaching! Is it a mirage?  Alien / mom:  Goodness, put on some sun screen and wear a hat if you&#39;re going to be out here.  Honestly, show a little common sense.  And don&#39;t give me that look.  Spaceman Spiff: Spiff survives, fixes his ship and sets off to find a more temperate planet with fewer aliens. A solitary zork circles high in the sweltering skies of a desert planet. Below, a thin plume of smoke rises from the wreckage of a small, red spacecraft!

Calvin:  Ahh, you&#39;ve fallen into my trap!  Maybe you&#39;d like to take that move over!  Hobbes:  Your remaining piece must have one heck of a plan.

Here are ordinary people having actual, horrible experiences, which are broadcast nationwide for the public&#39;s viewing amusement!  It&#39;s intrusion, exploitation, and voyeurism all in one!  You never know where a video camera will be!  Everything&#39;s fair game!  Hobbes:  Who&#39;d have guessed big brother would go commercial?  Calvin:  I love to snicker at other people&#39;s tragedy.

Dad:  That&#39;s what lazy, slipshod, careless, cut-corner workers call anyone who cares enough to do something right.  Calvin:  Am I in the presence of their king?  Should I kneel?  Dad:  If anything works in this world, it&#39;s because one of us took charge.

I&#39;m interested in people.  Hobbes:  You??  Calvin:  As an audience, I mean.  Hobbes:  Oh.

Start the stopwatch.  Hobbes: Shouldn&#39;t you answer her?  Calvin: Not yet. She doesn&#39;t see us, so she can&#39;t prove we heard her.  The trick is to listen to her tone of voice and answer just before she gets mad enough to come looking for us.  Mom: Calvin!!  Calvin: OK, that was it. Now we play innocent.  Are you calling me?  Mom: Come inside. It&#39;s time for bed. It&#39;s getting dark.  Calvin: Ha! She made a tactical blunder! Darkness is relative!  It&#39;s not dark!  Mom: Yes it is. Come inside. Calvin: I can still see my hands! It&#39;s not real dark!  Mom: It&#39;s dark enough. Let&#39;s go.  Calvin: Rats. She cut off debate before we could really define the terms. Now we have to bargain.  Can I stay out another ten minutes?  That&#39;s all I want!  Mom: No. Come in now.  Calvin: Five minutes then! Just five minutes, OK?  Mom: Now, Calvin!  Calvin: Darn. She&#39;s catching on! She guessed that my five minutes is her half-hour. We&#39;ll go for the fake agreement.  OK. I&#39;m coming.  Now we can stay out a little longer before she realizes I lied.  How&#39;s the time?  Hobbes: We&#39;ve dragged this out 53 seconds so far.  Calvin: Good. Let&#39;s go for the record! Oops. I lost my shoe.  Hobbes: Every minute outside and awake is a good minute.

First tiger Hobbes will read the minutes of our last meeting.  Hobbes:  Thank you.  &quot;9:30 - meeting called to order.  Dictator-for-life Calvin proposes resolution condemning existence of girls.  9:35 - first Tiger abstains from vote.  Motion fails.  9:36 - patriotism of first Tiger called into question.  9:37 - philosophical discussion.  10:15 - bandages administered.  Dictator-for-life rebuked for biting.&quot;  Calvin:  Is this a great club, or what?  Hobbes:  &quot;10:16 - forgot what debate was about.  Medals of bravery awarded to all parties.&quot;

Hobbes:  &quot;Dictator-for-life Calvin&#39;s bold proposal is greeted with huzzahs from membership.&quot;  Calvin:  We have tolerated the enemy&#39;s presence too long, I say!  Hobbes:  &quot;Shouts of assent.  Much pounding on tables.  Three cheers erupt for club ideals.  Membership reduced to tears.  More huzzahs.  Pandemonium ensues.&quot;  Calvin:  Boy, leading a club is a heady experience.  Hobbes:  Good meetings turn into riots.

As chief strategist, I suggest...  Hobbes:  Excuse me.  A question from the floor.  Calvin:  The chair recognizes first Tiger Hobbes.  Hobbes:  Exactly what &quot;enemy activity&quot; was the enemy engaged in?  Calvin:  You know, girl stuff!  Hobbes:  Ah.  Say no more.

We make up a fake code with fake instructions and see that it &quot;accidentally&quot; falls into Susie&#39;s hands!  She decodes the message, which says we don&#39;t want her to go behind our house!  Naturally, she&#39;ll go there, and we&#39;ll be waiting, ready to soak her with water ballons!  Hobbes:  Why don&#39;t we just hit her with water balloons right now, where she&#39;s sitting?  Calvin:  You&#39;re a good officer, Hobbes, but let&#39;s face it, you don&#39;t have an executive mind.  Hobbes:  I still think my idea sort of makes sense...

Obviously, the code will have to be easy to break, so she can read the disinformation we&#39;re giving her.  Hobbes:  How about if we write backwards?  Calvin:  Yeah, that&#39;s good!  Letter:  Dear Hobbes, (backwards).  Calvin:  Gosh, I hope Susie&#39;s not too dumb to figure this out.  Hobbes:  Cracking codes is second nature to cool spies like us.

Dear Hobbes, If Susie goes behind our house at noon, all our secret plans will be ruined!  Calvin.  (backwards).  Calvin:  There!  Once Susie decodes this message, she&#39;ll be lured to our water balloon trap!  What a great plan!  My only regret is blowing the best day of my life while I&#39;m so young.

I hate bees! Aiee! Yoww! Mom: I don&#39;t wee the &quot;harpoon&quot; that &quot;gored&quot; you, but this will help the sting. Calvin: Call the national guard. I&#39;m sure they can track the bee on radar.

Susie&#39;s still playing on the sidewalk!  We&#39;ll stroll by and &quot;accidentally&quot; drop the coded message.  Yes Hobbes.  I have a top secret coded letter for you here!  Verrry mysterious!  Verrrry secret!  Just make sure the note doesn&#39;t fall into a girl&#39;s hands!  If the code is broken and read, our plans will be ruined!  We did it!  Ha!  Everything is going perfectly!  Hobbes: ..Except she&#39;s not picking up the letter.

Doesn&#39;t she see it??  What&#39;s wrong with her?!  Doesn&#39;t she know enough to intercept somebody else&#39;s secret letter when it&#39;s dropped right in front of her??  Hobbes:  Maybe she wasn&#39;t paying attention to us.  Calvin:  That&#39;s inconceivable!  Who wouldn&#39;t be interested in everything we do?!
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|8|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/08/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4bf99cd0df960131725e005056a9545d|289|900|Hobbes:  Look!  Susie sees the letter!  She&#39;s picking it up!  She&#39;s reading the envelope!  Calvin: ...She&#39;s walking over here...  Susie:  You dropped this letter for Hobbes.  Here.  Calvin:  Um...gee, thanks.  Hobbes:  Well, that was awfully decent of her.  Calvin:  It&#39;s no use!  It&#39;s no use!  Everybody gets good enemies, except me!
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|8|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/08/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4d4fcf10df960131725e005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  Let&#39;s stroll over this way once again, Hobbes!  Hobbes:  Yes, let&#39;s!  Calvin:  It&#39;s a good thing you have that top secret coded letter, Hobbes!  It would be awful if you happened to drop it near Susie one more time!  If I were Susie, and I found the letter, I&#39;d pick it up and decode it, so I could ruin all our plans!  That would sure be bad for us!  Hobbes:  It worked!  She&#39;s opening the letter!  Calvin:  Good.  I was afraid we&#39;d have to hit her on the head and read it to her.

Hmph, not much of a code...just backward letters!  I can read it through the back of the page.  &quot;Dear Hobbes, If Susie goes behind our house at noon, all our secret plans will be ruined.  Calvin.&quot;  Gosh, it&#39;s almost noon!  I&#39;d better hurry over to Calvin&#39;s house if I want to spoil his plans!  Calvin:  Wheee!  Ha ha!  She fell for it!  C&#39;mon Hobbes, hurry!
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|8|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/08/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4ff6b130df960131725e005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Oh boy, this is going to be great!  Get the water balloons!  Hurry!  We&#39;ve got to hide before Susie gets here.  Ha ha!  She swallowed that fake letter hook, line, and sinker!  She thinks she&#39;s tricking us, but we&#39;ll trick her!  We&#39;re geniuses, Hobbes!  Hee hee!  Man, is she in for a surprise!  Hobbes:  I wonder what&#39;s keeping her.  Calvin:  She probably got lost.

Hobbes: I&#39;ll say. We didn&#39;t get to do half our itinerary.

Why isn&#39;t Susie walking into our brilliant ambush?!  Where is she?!  You stay here and guard the water balloons.  I&#39;ll go on a reconnaissance mission and find out what she&#39;s doing.  Hobbes:  Wait a minute.  Why can&#39;t I go on the reconnaissance mission?  Calvin:  Because if you got captured, you&#39;d tell Susie anything for a tummy rub.  Hobbes:  I might not!

We go to all this trouble to lure Susie into a trap, and she doesn&#39;t show up!  As soon as I find out where she is, I&#39;ll get Hobbes and the water balloons and we&#39;ll let her have it!  If she won&#39;t come to the ambush, we&#39;ll bring the ambush to her!  Susie:  Five...four...three...two...

Oh no!  Aiee!  Ackpth!  Pblbth!  Blubplub plpttb!  This doesn&#39;t go in the club log, understood?  It never happened.  Hobbes:  Since you&#39;re already wet, it would be a shame not to use these water balloons.

Our great plan backfired and I&#39;m the one who got soaked!  Oh, the shame!  The ignominy! ...sighhhh...  Hobbes:  If you resign, can I be the dictator-for-life?  Calvin:  I didn&#39;t say I was resigning!

This afternoon, we&#39;ll devise a bigger, better, and even more complicated scheme, and revenge will be ours!  The spirit of G.R.O.S.S.ness cannot be extinguished! ...And for courage in the face of temporary setbacks, I award us bottle caps of valor!  Hobbes:  Yayy!  Hobbes:  A good meeting always ends with us getting new medals!  Calvin:  This is such a great club!

Calvin:  Gee thanks, mom.  What do you say we break out the comic books while we think up our big plans?  Hobbes:  Oh boy!  Calvin:  It&#39;s looking like a good afternoon, ol&#39; buddy.  Hobbes:  I love summer.

That&#39;s the problem with life. It rolls along with speed you can&#39;t control. You can&#39;t go faster or slower.  Fun experiences always go roaring by. ...While bad experiences never pass quickly enough.  I wish we could choose how fast and slow events go.  For example, I&#39;d like to speed up childhood and get to driving age.  Hobbes: It&#39;s not the pace of life I mind. It&#39;s the sudden stop at the end.

What do I get?  Calvin:  Nothing.  I just ripped you off.  Susie:  What?!  Calvin:  That&#39;s life!  Hey!  Ow!  Ow!

I just remembered.  Some lady called about an hour ago.  Mom:  Did you get her name and number?  Calvin:  No...  Mom:  Well how am I supposed to call her back?!  Calvin:  You don&#39;t need to.  She&#39;s still on the line.

Man, was I ever in agony!  I was ricocheting off the walls all night!  I thought I was going to explode!  I gotta get a stunt double.

So I&#39;ve seen a few thousand homicides in my day! What&#39;s the big deal?!  It&#39;s my right to watch violence on TV! It&#39;s people like me who make these programs profitable! I say the customer is always right, and if advertisers want me to watch TV, they shows had better pander to my tastes!  ...And frankly, I like to watch shoot outs, car wrecks, fist fights, and grisly murders! I like to be entertained!  Hobbes: Don&#39;t you worry that all this violence is desensitizing?  Calvin: Nahh. I&#39;d like to shoot the idiots who think this stuff affects me.

I could cover miles in no time at all!  I could go anywhere!  I could...AAAAAAAAAAA!  I could go to heaven.  Hobbes:  You?  I doubt it.

I don&#39;t like you and you don&#39;t like me.  But I&#39;ve got the tools to reduce you to a pile of pipes, sprockets, and ball bearings!  Do we understand each other?  AAAAAAAAAAA!  Maybe altogether too well.

Dad:  I think you should learn how to ride before you worry about having a bell to ring.  Calvin:  Not that kind of bell!  I want one that&#39;ll warn me when the darn bike&#39;s sneaking up on me!

He&#39;s trying to bump me off!  He knows the bike will stop at nothing to kill me.  Dad figures pretty soon I&#39;ll have my head through a tree trunk and he&#39;ll have some peace and quiet!  I&#39;m on to him!  Hobbes:  I suppose that&#39;s easier than sending you to camp and moving.  Calvin:  Well sure.  What if the house didn&#39;t sell?

Calvin:  Mm...I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;m not enthusiastic about setting the table.  I don&#39;t think you should have to do something unless you&#39;re enthusiastic about it.

Hobbes:  Oh?  Calvin:  Then I thought, why wait until I&#39;m a teen-ager?!  I want to be idolized now!  Hobbes:  Then you should probably blow your nose more regularly.  Calvin:  Want an autographed 8 * 10 glossy?

Hobbes:  What&#39;s misunderstood about you?  Calvin:  Nobody thinks I&#39;m a genius.

Dad:  Well, it&#39;s not too different from being a kid...except you&#39;re more attached to your toys.

I wondered, is it better to do the right thing and fail ...or is it better to do the wrong thing and succeed?  One the one hand, undeserved success gives no satisfaction. ...But on the other hand, well-deserved failure gives no satisfaction either.  Of course, most everybody cheats some time or other. People always bend the rules if they think they can get away with it. ...Then again, that doesn&#39;t justify my cheating.  Then I thought, look, cheating on one little test isn&#39;t such a big deal. It doesn&#39;t hurt anyone.  ...But then I wondered if I was just rationalizing my unwillingness to accept the consequences of not studying.  Still, in the real world, people care about success, not principles. ...Then again, maybe that&#39;s why the world is in such a mess. What a dilemma!  Hobbes: So what did you decide?  Calvin: Nothing. I ran out of time and I had to turn in a blank paper.  Hobbes: Anymore, simply acknowledging the issue is a moral victory.  Calvin: Well it just seemed wrong to cheat on an ethics test.

I feel like I&#39;ve been run over by a train.  I mean, now I feel like that.  Hobbes:  See?  You should always save hyperbole until you really need it.

I&#39;ll demonstrate.  Tweeeeet.  Young child:  What&#39;s so amazing about that?!  It sounds like an ordinary whistle to me!  Calvin:  It can only be heard by ugly cretins.  Young child:  I&#39;ll get you at recess, Calvin.

Calvin:  I feel sorry for you, Moe.  You must have some serious personal problems if this is how you relate to people.  Then again, maybe he&#39;s just a world-class poophead.

Hobbes: It must&#39;ve hit the window.  Calvin: Isn&#39;t it beautiful? It&#39;s so delicate.  Sighhh.... Once it&#39;s too late, you appreciate what a miracle life is.  You realize that nature is ruthless and our existence is very fragile, temporary, and precious.  But to go on with your daily affairs, you can&#39;t really think about that.  ...Which is probably why everyone takes the world for granted and why we act so thoughtlessly.  It&#39;s very confusing.  I suppose it will all make sense when we grow up.  Hobbes: No doubt.

Dad:  Mm.  Calvin:  A vast majority of household six-year-olds say you&#39;re not living up to their expectations of fatherhood.  Dad:  What were their expectations?  Calvin:  That you&#39;d be more like an automatic teller machine.  Dad:  Where do you pollsters find these respondents?

Once you become informed, you start seeing complexities and shades of gray.  You realize that nothing is as clear and simple as it first appears.  Ultimately, knowledge is paralyzing.  Being a man of action, I can&#39;t afford to take that risk.  Hobbes:  You&#39;re ignorant, but at least you act on it.

Pretty soon, computers, telephones and TVs will all be hooked together to bring instanteous, interactive communication right into our homes!  But dad says he liked it better when you had to communicate by mail, and you knew you wouldn&#39;t hear back from anybody for at least a week.  Hobbes:  Of course, your dad thinks transportation should&#39;ve stopped with the bicycle.  Calvin:  I&#39;m a 21st century kid trapped in a 19th century family.

Don&#39;t hit me!  There&#39;s something on your back!  Moe:  I&#39;m sure.  Calvin:  I&#39;m serious!  It&#39;s a note!  Your mom must&#39;ve pinned it on your shirt.  Moe:  What&#39;s it say?  Calvin:  It says, &quot;Somebody run this boy over with a truck.&quot;  Calvin:  If I&#39;m going to get clobbered, I like to deserve it.

It doesn&#39;t tell what month it is, though.  I need a watch that tells the month.  Hobbes:  I suppose they figure if you don&#39;t know what month it is, you&#39;re not the type who&#39;d wear a watch.

Hobbes:  Can we tour a prison afterward?  Calvin:  No thanks.

What&#39;s the answer to question two?  Susie:  &quot;Eli Whitney and the cotton gin.&quot;  Calvin:  But this is a math problem.  Susie:  It&#39;s a trick question.  Calvin:  How come you wrote something different?  Susie:  I&#39;m going to get this question wrong, so ti won&#39;t look like you copied.  Calvin:  Wow, thanks!  Susie:  Oh, I owe it to you.

Hobbes:  How will you get to heaven if you like to be bad?  Calvin:  Let&#39;s say I didn&#39;t do what I wanted to do.  Suppose I led a blameless life!  Suppose I denied my true dark nature!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m not sure I have that much imagination.  Calvin:  Maybe heaven is a place where you&#39;re allowed to be bad!

It&#39;s obvious you haven&#39;t read any of the material.  Our first president was not Chef Boy-ar-dee and you ought to be ashamed to have turned in such preposterous answers!  Calvin:  I just don&#39;t test well.

If you dry your teeth, you can curl your upper lip and it will stick!  See?  Then you take a piece of tape...and use it to pull your nostrils up!  Cool, huh?  Hobbes:  Wow!  I&#39;ll bet if you showed your dad, he&#39;d go to work like that!  Calvin:  Yeah!

Just think!  Pretty soon we&#39;ll have read all of this!  I like to read ahead and see what we&#39;re going to learn next.  It&#39;s so exciting to know stuff.  Having a book is like having a good friend with you.  Calvin:  If you flip the pages of my book, an animated T. Rex drives the batmobile and explodes!  Susie:  Sometimes I think books are the only friends worth having.

I don&#39;t need to learn!  I can always get by on my good looks and charm!  I don&#39;t hear you concurring, hairball breath.

They sell an attitude!  Look at this one!  Here&#39;s a cool guy saying nobody tells him what to do.  He does whatever he wants and he buys this product as a reflection of that independence.  Hobbes:  So basically, this maverick is urging everyone to express his individuality through conformity in brand-name selection?  Calvin:  Well, it sounded more defiant the way he said it.  Hobbes:  Mm.

This guy didn&#39;t like his job, so he quit, and now he climbs rocks!  See, he&#39;s his own man!  He grabs life by the throat and lives on his own terms!  Hobbes:  If he quit his job, I wonder how he affords those expensive athletic shoes he&#39;s advertising.  Calvin:  Maybe his mom bought them for him.  Hobbes:  I hope she&#39;ll pay his medical bills when he falls off that rock.

Not me, though!  That&#39;s the difference between me and the rest of the world!  Happiness isn&#39;t good enough for me!  I demand euphoria!  The problem with you, Hobbes, is you&#39;re always at a loss for words.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ve found that saves many a friendship.

Before you wallop me, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to sign this form.  Moe:  What&#39;s this?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a statement acknowledging responsibiltiy for your behavior.  You agree that hitting me entitles me to unlimited compensation for medical treatment as well as reasonable damages for pain and suffering.  You affirm that you&#39;re insured for these costs and...  Nobody takes responsibility for his actions anymore.

It&#39;s an agreement that you&#39;ll compensate me for any loss of job income I may suffer as an adult because of a poor first-grade education.  Miss Wormwood:  If you get a poor first-grade education, it will be from your lack of effort, not mine.  Get back to your desk.  Calvin:  By golly, somebody ought to pay me if I don&#39;t learn anything.

Hobbes:  People are friends because they want to be, not because they have to be!  Calvin:  That&#39;s what this fixes.  Hobbes:  If your friends are contractual, you don&#39;t have any.

Dad:  If your lids weren&#39;t closed, the force of the explosion would blow your eyeballs out and stretch the optic nerve, so your eyes would flop around and you&#39;d have to point them with your hands to see anything.  Calvin:  Gross.  How come you know so much?  Dad:  It&#39;s all in the book you get when you become a father.

The struggle to bring down its prey has given Calvin a monstrous appetite!  With massive jaws twisting violently at the carcass, he rigs apart gigantic chunks and swallows them whole! What a disgusting spectacle of savage gluttony!  Mom: That&#39;s enough for tonight, Calvin. You&#39;re going to get sick if you eat all that.  Calvin: But mom, I earned it!

Dad:  Right.  Calvin:  Can I see it?  Dad:  Nope, sorry.  Calvin:  Why not?  Dad:  It tells what it&#39;s like to raise a kid.  Calvin:  So?!  Dad:  You&#39;re not allowed to know that until it&#39;s too late not to have one.

A person should be safe from predators inside his own house!  Hobbes:  If I had reflexes like yours, I&#39;d be glad for the opportunity to improve them.

Well, I&#39;d better get to the office.  Calvin:  That was obviously some sort of commentary.

Hobbes:  Zz.  Zz...hmm?  Oh yes, I&#39;m very fond of Calvin. ..Pass the gravy, please.  Zzz.  Calvin:  Brrr...  Hobbes:  Zz.

I&#39;m just going to get dirty again.  Why should I brush my teeth?  I&#39;m just going to eat again.  Why should I comb my hair?  It&#39;s just going to get messed up again.

What would it be? Hobbes: Hmmm. Calvin: Anything at all! Whatever you want! Hobbes: A sandwich. Calvin: A sandwich?!? What kind of stupid wish is that?! Talk about a failure of imagination! I&#39;d ask for a trillion billion dollars, my own space shuttle, and a private continent! Hobbes: I got my wish.

Mom:  Yes...  Calvin:  Did you find anything...um...surprising?  Mom:  Like what?  Calvin:  Let&#39;s just say we need some big gloves and a heavy stick...fast.

Mom packed a piece of pie in my lunch!  She hates me!  I refuse to eat it!  Susie:  You don&#39;t like pie?  Calvin:  Not this kind.  Susie:  What kind is it?  Calvin:  Cow pie.

Mom:  Stinky.  Calvin:  Stinky??  Mom:  Stinky.  Calvin:  It&#39;s always shocking to see one&#39;s existence reduced to a blurb.

Hobbes:  What&#39;s the assignment?  Calvin:  I&#39;m supposed to write a paper that presents both sides of an issue and then defends one of the arguments.  Hobbes:  What&#39;s your issue?  Calvin:  That&#39;s the problem.  I can&#39;t think of anything to argue.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s hard to believe.  Calvin:  I&#39;m always right and everybody else is always wrong!  What&#39;s to argue about?!

Hobbes:  Well, what issues do you care about?  Calvin:  I don&#39;t care about issues!  I&#39;ve got better things to do than argue with every wrong-headed crackpot with an ignorant opinion!  I&#39;m a busy man!  I say, either agree with me or take a hike!  I&#39;m right, period!  End of discussion!  Hobbes:  Um...right.  Calvin:  There, see?  Everybody&#39;s happy.

Hobbes:  Hmm...we&#39;ll need to put on our thinking caps.  Calvin:  Hey!  Thinking caps!  That&#39;s what we need!  C&#39;mon!  This is a great idea!  Boy, where would I be without you?  Hobbes:  Conceivably, you might be working on your assignment.

Its metal surface can conduct electrical brain impulses and reflect brain waves!  Next we&#39;ll need to attach those input and output strings and a grounding string.  Hobbes:  Why a grounding string?  Calvin:  It&#39;s like a lightning rod for brainstorms...I want to keep my ideas grounded in reality.  Hobbes:  I think you&#39;re too late.  Calvin:  We&#39;ll also need to build a transformer for the atomic cerebral enhance-o-tron.

Calvin:  Evidently, an unanticipated physiological consequence of cerebral augmentation.  My brain swelled.  Hobbes:  If your hats don&#39;t fit, will you give them to me?  Calvin:  My powerful brain is unraveling the mysteries of the universe.  It&#39;s amazing!  All natural laws can be reduced to one simple, unifying equation!  Hobbes:  Really?  What is it?  Calvin:  Already my powerful brain is bored with such simple problems and is now working on why girls are so obnoxious.

It&#39;s a perfect day for us snowmen! What a great spot for a few feet of snow! Yes, sir, a snowman like me could be real happy here!  Sighhh. Hobbes: The decoy isn&#39;t working?  Calvin: Maybe ducks are easier to fool than snow.

Calvin:  I concur.  Mom:  Calvin, dinner time.  Hobbes:  Uh oh.  Wait until your parents see your head!  Calvin:  I am applying my powerful brain to the dilemma.  I know!  We&#39;ll wrap my head in this bedsheet!  That will allay any suspicion!  Hobbes:  Your powerful brain must know something I don&#39;t.

I&#39;m not calling you again!  Calvin:  Hurry up with the turban!  Hobbes:  There.  Calvin:  Sorry I&#39;m late.  I was unavoidably detained.  Dad:  Calvin, we don&#39;t eat at the table looking like that.  Take off the sheet.  Calvin:  Uh...heh heh...um...  Dad:  Thank you.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t know why I worry.  They never notice anything.

Obviously I don&#39;t need to eat brain food now.  Hobbes:  Oh boy.  Calvin:  Ok, let&#39;s get down to business.  I&#39;ll apply my powerful brain to the problem of my homework. ...Hmmmmmm...  Hobbes:  How&#39;s it going?  Calvin:  Good!  I just remembered what the assignment was.

Hobbes:  Great.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll write about the debate over Tyrannosaurs.  Were they fearsome predators or disgusting scavengers?  Hobbes:  Which side will you defend?  Calvin:  Oh, I believe they were fearsome predators, definitely.  Hobbes:  How come?  Calvin:  They&#39;re so much cooler that way.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|11|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/11/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/c34e0a80df960131725e005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  Let&#39;s see...to argue that Tyrannosaurs were predators and not scavengers, we&#39;ll need to write a brief overview of carnosaur evolution.  Then we&#39;ll delve into skeletal structure, skull design, arm strength, potential running speed, and enviromental factors. ...But first, we&#39;ll draw some pictures of a T. Rex eating people in the natural history museum.  Hobbes:  I notice your head is shrinking back to normal size.

Calvin:  The brain enhancement must have worn off.  Hobbes:  But you haven&#39;t written your paper yet.  Calvin:  Oh, that&#39;s the easy part.  The hard part was getting a topic and making these funny drawings.  Now all I have to do is write everything I know about Tyrannosaurs.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.  For once I&#39;m guaranteed a good grade!  Mom:  Calvin, time for bed.

Calvin: You&#39;re a robot?? Robot doctor: Ha, ha. Affirmative. We wouldn&#39;t trust a delicate operation like this to clumsy human hands, now would we?  Calvin: Um...I guess not.  Robot doctor: How&#39;s the anesthetic? Feel anything?  Calvin: ...no... Robot doctor: Good. This will just take a moment.  Hold this jar, would you? Ta de tupi tupi...A little gray matter here, a dab there...Ah, that should do it.  Calvin: Wow, that was easy!  Robot doctor: How do you feel?  Calvin: Smart!  Robot doctor: This knowledge implant should provide you all the wisdom you&#39;ll ever need.  Calvin: Great! No more school!  Thanks, doctor!  Robot doctor: Go home and have 12 years of fun. Calvin: Sighhh

Mom:  That&#39;s what I said.  Calvin:  But I haven&#39;t finished my paper for school yet!  I need more time!  Mom:  How much more do you have to do?  Calvin:  I just have to write it.

What have you been doing all evening??  Calvin:  Well first, Hobbes and I invented and constructed a thinking cap that augmented my brain so I could think up a good topic, and then we drew illustrations of...  Mom:  That doesn&#39;t sound like a very good time budget to me.  Calvin:  I wasn&#39;t expecting to get audited so soon.

Just great!  Mom lets us stay up half an hour longer to finish this paper.  How am I supposed to do a good job in so little time?!  Hobbes:  Your mom says you wasted the whole evening.  Calvin:  But now she&#39;s making me do a rushed, slipshod job!  I&#39;ll have to compromise the quality!  I won&#39;t get the &quot;A&quot; I deserve!  Hobbes:  Especially since  you&#39;ve used up 15 minutes complaining about it.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll tell the teacher it&#39;s my mom&#39;s fault.

Hobbes:  At least you finished your paper.  Calvin:  Yeah, but it could&#39;ve been a lot better.  I finally get a chance to write about something I know backward and forward and I have to rush the whole thing.  Hobbes:  Well, with the time available, you did the best you could. ...Sort of.  Calvin:  I think geniuses should be given special considerations.

The end.&quot;  I&#39;m a concise writer, ok?!?

She said I&#39;d had plenty of time to do the assignment, but she admitted that maybe I&#39;d picked too complex a subject.  So she raised my grade to a &quot;D&quot; and told me I should try to pick realistic goals and plan my time better.  Hobbes:  I guess we learned a lesson, huh?  Calvin:  I&#39;ll say smooth-talking the teacher really pays off!

What a pathetic cliche!  Am I supposed to identify with this complacent moron and his shovel?? This snowman says nothing about the human condition! Is this all the kid has to say abotu contemporary suburban life?  The soulless banality of this snowman is a sad comment on today&#39;s art world.  Now come look at my snowman. I call it &quot;The torment of existence weighed against the horror of nonbeing.&quot;  As he melts, the sculpture will become even more poignant.  Hobbes: I admire your willingness to put artistic integrity before marketability.

You&#39;re supposed to wait until I hike the ball!!  Hobbes:  Oops.  Sorry.  Calvin:  Darn tigers.  You can explain the rules to &#39;em, but you can&#39;t suppress their surprise pounce instinct.

He said he wanted to read something long, rich, and thought-provoking for a change, and he wanted a cloth binding so his book could be carried around and reread later.  Then he said he was going to buy the book with cash, so nobody could trace the purchase to him and exploit his interests for commercial purposes.  Hobbes:  Your dad&#39;s going into the future kicking and screaming, isn&#39;t he?  Calvin:  What if he&#39;s turning into some kind of subversive?

I want a winged serpent coiling around one arm, clutching a ship on my chest, with...um...I mean...well...sighhhh...Did you know mom can communicate telepathically?

Calvin:  You&#39;d better be nice to me, Moe.  Moe:  Haw!  Why?  Calvin:  Because someday my tax dollars will be paying for your prison cell.  My whole problem is my lips move when I think.

Hobbes:  Interesting observation.  Calvin:  Well, it just occurred to me.  Wahoooooooo...

But obviously the play is unrehearsed and everybody is ad-libbing his lines.  Hobbes:  Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to tell if we&#39;re in a tragedy or a farce.  Calvin:  We need more special effects and dance numbers.

Calvin: I should&#39;ve stayed at second base! Hobbes: You&#39;ve still got a snowman at third. CalviN: I love a good game of speed sled base sno ball!
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|12|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/12/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d8908ce0df960131725e005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Yep, Christmas is just around the corner.  And what better way to celebrate a religious holiday than with a month of frenzied consumerism!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m surprised other religions haven&#39;t picked up on that.  Calvin:  Getting loads of loot is a very spiritual experience for me.

And every year you callously ignore it and bring me practical things I don&#39;t want at all.  What&#39;s the deal?!  Are you insane??  Have you gone senile??  Can&#39;t you read??  Or are you just a vindictive, twisted elf bent on destroying little kids&#39; dreams?!?!  Hobbes:  You might want to sleep on this one.  Calvin:  I know, but it felt good to write it.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|12|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/12/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/db53fec0df960131725e005056a9545d|284|900|Letter:  Dear Santa, Last year I did not receive the 15,000 items I requested for Christmas.  I can only conclude that your secretarial staff must be a bunch of underpaid and woefully unprepared temps, and my letter was misfiled.  To avoid a similar disaster this year, just write me a check for five million dollars, and I&#39;ll buy the stuff myself.  Calvin:  See, this year I won&#39;t be disappointed.  Hobbes:  I&#39;d leave out the part about the temps.

Enclosed is a list of what I want for Christmas.  Please don&#39;t confuse my list with Calvin&#39;s.  There are two kids at this house now.  Calvin:  Man, if Santa falls for this, I&#39;ll add a new brother every year!  Hobbes:  &quot;Melville&quot;?

Ha!  Nothing in life is ever easy.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|12|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/12/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e01cb840df960131725e005056a9545d|286|900|Hobbes:  Look at all this snow!  Calvin:  I&#39;m being tested.  We got this snow so I&#39;d be tempted to smack Susie with a slushball and forfeit all my Christmas presents.  To evaluate my character, my immediate pleasure is being pitted against my future greed!  Hobbes:  Poor Susie.  Calvin:  It&#39;s not a foregone conclusion!
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|12|19|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/12/19|https://assets.amuniversal.com/245c4a30784d01302116001dd8b71c47|625|900|Calvin (reading):  My hands were all shaky, my face had gone pale. A letter from Santa just arrived in the mail! It was hand-written in old-fashioned ink pen. It was handsomely printed and dated twelve ten. &quot;Dear Calvin,&quot; it said. &quot;I&#39;m writing because this year I&#39;ve repealed my &#39;naughty/nice&#39; laws. So now, I urge you: be vulgar and crude! I like it when children are boorish and rude!  Burp at the table! Gargle your peas! Never say &#39;thank you&#39;, &#39;you&#39;re welcome&#39; or &#39;please.&#39; Talk back to your mother! Don&#39;t do as you&#39;re told! Stick your tongue out at your dad if he scolds! Drive everyone crazy, I really don&#39;t care! Act like a jerk! Anytime, anywhere!  I&#39;m changing the rules! The bad girls and boys will be, from now on, the ones who get toys!  Good little kids make me sick, it&#39;s no joke. Sincerely, Signed Santa&quot;   ...And then I awoke.  I hate being good (or trying to fake it). Six days until Christmas! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make it.

Refraining from throwing these snowballs in the hope of being rewarded at Christmas is delayed and uncertain pleasure.  As usual, goodness hardly puts up a fight.
Sat Jan 29 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1993|12|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/12/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e5ce7410df960131725e005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  What if there is no Santa Claus?  You know, a lot of this Santa stuff is hard to believe.  The flying reindeer, going around the world in one night, the whole chimney bit...what if it&#39;s all some cruel hoax and I&#39;m being good for nothing?  Hobbes:  You&#39;ve always been good for nothing!  Calvin:  If he exists, Santa will forgive this one.

I&#39;m just...um...exuberant!  There&#39;s nothing wrong with being exuberant!  Heads up!  Hobbes:  Go on, explain the semantics to your mom.  Calvin:  Yikes, she got her wind back and she&#39;s gaining!

Calvin:  I figure this doesn&#39;t really count against me, since she&#39;s so sanctimonious and I keep missing.

Acquittal on all charges!  Complete exoneration!  Ha ha ha!  Mom:  Merry Christmas to you too, dear.  Dad:  Phew, what&#39;s that smell?  Has someone been eating tuna fish at this horrible hour?!

Calvin: Nope! I want everything to stay the same as it was this year.  Hobbes: Everything?  Calvin: Right. This year was lousy, but at least it&#39;s familiar.  I hate change! It&#39;s too disruptive! When things are different, you have to think about the change and deal with it!  I like things to stay the same, so I can take everything for granted!  Besides, things keep changing for the worse! The longer I live, the more complicated everything gets! I say let&#39;s stop here before life gets any harder.  From now on, no more change.  I&#39;m bored. Let&#39;s do something different.  Hobbes: Some things don&#39;t change.

Dad:  Because a ski lift would be ugly, noisy, and completely unnecessary.  Calvin:  The problem with Dad is he doesn&#39;t know progress when he hears it.

Dad:  What for?  Calvin:  Mine is outdated.  I&#39;m sure the &#39;94 models have all sorts of new features, colors and options.  Dad:  Toboggans don&#39;t come in model years.  Calvin:  They don&#39;t??  I tell you, Hobbes, there&#39;s a fortune to be made!

Calvin: All right, I lied. Sue me.

Let&#39;s look for animal traces!  Here are some bird tracks. Look, you can see wing impressions where they took off!  And these are rabbit tracks. Looks like they were going pretty fast.  No wonder! Look at these tracks! Something was chasing them all over the place!  Hmm...big pads... could be a wolf, but there are no claw impressions. It&#39;s more like a bobcat, or a mountain lion, or... ...or... This explains the cold wet feet in my bed this morning.  Hobbes:  The snow was falling and I thought, &quot;the birds and rabbits around here need some exercise.&quot;

They complain about the least little thing! Calvin: If something bugs them, they never let go of it1 They just go on and on, long after anyone else is interested! It&#39;s just complain, compain, complain! People who gripe all the time really drive me nuts! Calvin: You&#39;d think they&#39;d change the subject after a while but they never do! They just keep griping until you start to wonder, &quot;What&#39;s wrong withthis idiot?&quot; But they go on complaining and repeating what they&#39;ve already said!

Here I stop, hear something, and start to turn around. Calvin: A few feet farther on, here&#39;s the impression of my body as I hit the ground. These are the powdered remains of the snowball that hit me. Calvin: From the angle of particle dispersement, we can tell the snowball was thrown from over here, where we find... Calvin: ... tiger tracks. Hobbes: Those could be ANYBODY&#39;S tiger tracks.

But girls don&#39;t get any toys when they grow up. Women just buy clothes and shoes. How boring. How sad.

How jejune!  Stupid kid. If you don&#39;t have anything to say, just keep quiet!  Well this is certainly shocking! Face it kid, provoking a reaction isn&#39;t the same thing as saying something significant!  Look, pal, there&#39;s no point expressing ideas if you can&#39;t have them understood!  You&#39;re just babbling to yourself!  And aren&#39;t we all bored with irony by now?  You just think you&#39;re above it all, kid!

We have more leisure than man has ever had. And what do we do with this leisure? Educate ourselves: Take up new interests? Explore? Invent? Create? Calvin: Dad, I can&#39;t hear this commercial.

For example, if you say, &quot;Go to bed NOW.&quot; You can use this card, which says, &quot;You&#39;ve got ten minutes until I blow my stack.&quot; See? Then I&#39;ll know what you mean.

Hobbes: I bet you can&#39;t. Calvin: Oh yeah?! How much? Hobbes: A hundred dollars. Calvin: You&#39;re on, Fuzzbrain. Get out your wallet! Boy, five inches higher would&#39;ve done it. You always get me in trouble. Hobbes: You owe me $2,500 so far.

OOmf! See? See?! That&#39;s what he does when I come home!! Hobbes: He thinks you tossed me in the air?! Why, I&#39;ve never been so insulted in my life! Calvin: I need to get a video camera.

It&#39;s awfully cold out, but I suppose I could bundle up. It looks windy though. But still, I&#39;d like to go sledding. Then again, maybe I&#39;d rather stay in. On the other hand... Mom: Go out and close the door! Calvin: The more indecisive I am, the faster things get decided.

News organizations know I won&#39;t sit still for any serious discussion of complex and boring issues.  They give me what I want: antics, emotional confrontation, sound bites, scandal, sob stories and popularity polls all packaged as a soap opera and horse race!  It&#39;s very entertaining.  Hobbes:  Then commentators wonder why the public is cynical about politics.  Calvin:  You can tell this is an in-depth story, because it&#39;s got an article next to the chart.

If I went in wearing shoes and a shirt, but no pants, they&#39;d have to serve me!  Hobbes:  They&#39;d probably serve you with a court summons.  Calvin:  C&#39;mon.  Let&#39;s see if mom will take us out for dinner!

Hobbes:  Watcha doin&#39;?  Calvin:  I&#39;ve hidden a cache of snowballs behind every tree in the yard!  Now when my enemies come after me, I need only run to the nearest tree to be instantly armed.  Hobbes:  Ingenious.  Calvin:  Now I need to make some enemies.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll be one.

Nature doesn&#39;t care if people live or die.  It refuses to be tamed.  It does whatever it wants and acts like people don&#39;t matter.  It won&#39;t confirm our right to be here.  That drives people crazy.  We can&#39;t stand being ignored.  It&#39;s insulting and...hey!  Hobbes:  YAWWNN!  Calvin:  I think that&#39;s also why some people don&#39;t like cats.

Hobbes:  What&#39;s it about?  Calvin:  It&#39;s about a guy who flicks through TV channels with his remote control.  They say to write what you know!

Sighhhh,  that is the question. Whether &#39;tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...or to take arms against a sea of troubles...and by opposing, end them? To die; to sleep... no more! And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to..&quot;sniff&quot; &#39;tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep! To sleep, perchance to dream: Ay there&#39;s the rub! ...for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause....&quot; Feeheelinggs, ho ho ho. Mom: You finished that right up! Did you like it? Calvin: Let&#39;s not have this ever again.

Somebody pull the fire alarm!  Help!!  It&#39;s out of control!  It&#39;s spreading!  Aughh!  Put it out!!  Miss Wormwood:  It&#39;s not my fault!  It was an accident!  Miss Wormwood:  Maybe this will teach you a lesson!  Ha ha ha!  Calvin:  No!  No!  Ackk!  Help!  Get the PTA!  Miss Wormwood&#39;s an alien!

Gaaa!!  Hehh..hoo..hah..hehh...it was just a dream...my homework didn&#39;t explode..I&#39;m not..My homework!  I forgot to do my homework!  Hobbes:  I wish he&#39;d sleep outside.

I forgot to do my math homework!  Hobbes:  It&#39;s two in the morning.  Calvin:  But Miss Wormwood&#39;s going to collect it tomorrow!  If I don&#39;t have it, she&#39;ll kill me!  I had a nightmare about it!  C&#39;mon, we&#39;ll have to do the assignment now, while there&#39;s still time!  Hobbes:  This feels like a nightmare too.  Calvin:  Do you think if we woke up mom she&#39;d let us have coffee?

It&#39;s really snowing!  Pretty creepy.  Hobbes:  Things are always creepy at 2:00 a.m.  Calvin:  Hey, I&#39;ll bet tomorrow&#39;s a snow day!  I&#39;ll bet they close the schools!  Let&#39;s call the superintendent and see!  If tomorrow&#39;s a snow day, we can go right back to bed!...Or maybe we will anyway.  Dad:  You have two seconds to improve my mood.  Superintendent:  Who is this?!!?

Some idiot dumped trash out here! People seem to forget that others of us have to live on this planet too. You know, I don&#39;t understand why humans evolved as such thoughtless, shortsighted creatures.  Hobbes: Well, it can&#39;t stay that way forever.  Calvin: You think we&#39;ll get smarter?  Hobbes: That&#39;s one of the two possibilities.  Calvin: Maybe we&#39;ll stop polluting before it&#39;s too late.  Hobbes: We&#39;re all holding our breath.
Fri Nov 25 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1994|3|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/03/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d3447b20e04701317304005056a9545d|286|900|Mom:  Time to get up, Calvin.  Calvin:  Is it a snow day?  Did they close the schools?  Mom:  I&#39;ve got the radio on, so we&#39;ll hear.  Get ready anyway, though.  Calvin:  Oh man, I hope I hope I hope!  If schools closed, I&#39;ll have the whole day to do the math homework I forgot yesterday.  If school&#39;s open, I&#39;m in big trouble.  Suddenly I feel extremely religious. Hobbes:  Another deathbed conversion.

They just announced the schools are closed!  It&#39;s a snow day!  Wheeeee!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Hobbes:  Talk about luck!  Now you can do your homework and you won&#39;t get in trouble!  Calvin:  Right, but there&#39;s over two feet of snow that requires our immediate and undivided attention.  Hobbes:  First things first.  Calvin:  Math will still be there when the snow melts.
Fri Nov 25 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1994|3|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/03/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d6027e70e04701317304005056a9545d|284|900|Hobbes:  Don&#39;t you think you&#39;d enjoy this more if you did your math assignment first, so it wasn&#39;t hanging over your head?  Calvin:  I&#39;m a practical man, Hobbes.  I don&#39;t waste time thinking about hypothetical situations.  I deal with the world her and now.  And the incontrovertible fact is that I&#39;m outside in the snow!  That&#39;s reality!  That&#39;s what I think about!  Hobbes:  Tomorrow&#39;s a reality too.  Calvin:  Hypothtically, it might be another snow day.
Fri Nov 25 1994 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1994|3|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/03/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d75645d0e04701317304005056a9545d|288|900|Hobbes:  What a busy day!  I&#39;m pooped!  Calvin:  Mom says the roads are pretty clear, so school will probably open again tomorrow.  Now I wish I&#39;d done my math homework instead of playing outside all day...or I wish I&#39;d done it before dinner...or after dinner...or instead of watching TV...or before bed.  But now it&#39;s too late.  A day can really slip by when you&#39;re deliberately avoiding what you&#39;re supposed to do.

Now the teacher&#39;s going to collect it and I&#39;m as good as dead.  Why did I do this to myself?!  I even had an extra day to get it done!  Instead, I goofed off and now I&#39;m going to pay for it!  Boy, I&#39;ve learned my lesson!  This day has been nothing but dread, and I could&#39;ve avoided it all!  Here she comes!  Goodbye, world!  Miss Wormwood:  I&#39;ll collect your homework tomorrow, class.  Calvin:  Susie, quick, am I sitting in a beam of light?  Susie:  Looks more like a puddle of sweat.  Why?

The bell rang just as the teacher was about to collect the homework I didn&#39;t do!  Hobbes:  That&#39;s twice you&#39;ve been saved at the last minute.  Calvin:  But I&#39;ve learned my lesson this time.  From now on, it&#39;s work before pleasure!  No exceptions!  And it will be a pleasure to have that homework done!  C&#39;mon let&#39;s work on a snowman.  Hobbes:  No exceptions.

Dad: Mm..not really. Here&#39;s a &quot;you&#39;re not covering the cost of all these mailings&quot; charity request. You got a &quot;you&#39;re not attractive enough&quot; women&#39;s magazine with an article on swimsuits that minimize all your body flaws. Here are some &quot;you&#39;re not stylish or ostentatious enough&quot; catalogs...and coincidentally, an invitation to go deeper in debt from a credit card company. And here&#39;s our news magazine to identify the trend of the week we&#39;re missing...and I got a hobby magazine featuring equipment I ought to have. Yikes. Why do I get the feeling that society is trying to make us discontented with everything we do and insecure about who we are?  Mom: I suppose if people thought about real issues and needs instead of manufactured desires, the economy would collapse and we&#39;d have total anarchy.  Dad: So pitching this junk would make me some kind of terrorist, huh?  Mom: Yep. It&#39;s our patriotic duty to buy distractions from a simple life.  Calvin: Hey Mom, I saw a bunch of products on TV that I didn&#39;t know existed, but I desperately need!

Hobbes:  I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s even such a category.  Calvin:  In that case, call me &quot;champ&quot;!

Dad:  Is that a fact.  Calvin:  From now on, my goal is to feel good about myself.  Dad:  You&#39;re going to work harder at everything and build some character?  Calvin:  No.  I&#39;m going to whine until I get the special treatment I like.  Dad:  I wonder if anyone else is as scared about the future as I am.  Calvin:  I&#39;ve found that immediate gratification is the only thing that helps me.

What&#39;s this, something scraped off the bottom of boots??  I&#39;m not eating it!  Mom:  Calvin, I made this last week and you said it was your favorite meal of all time and you wished we could have it every day for the rest of your life!  Calvin:  Well, now I hate it.

See, here I start with a layer of brown.  Then I add olive green and scrub a little orange and yellow ochre into it.  Finally, I top it with lime green, purple, and tan.  Hobbes:  Wow, perfect barf!  Calvin:  You&#39;d think that would be a standard color in a big set like this.

Spaceman Spiff/Calvin: Hey, what kind of dungeon is this?! Aren&#39;t you going to torture me?  Yukbarf alien: Oh yes!

Nothing worth having ever comes easy. Virtue is its own reward. And when I was your age...

I am Blor-utar from Zimtok-5.  I have come to subjugate the human race.  Do not resist.  Why humans?  Because, in addition to their value as slave labor, they are also delicious and nutritous!  Ha ha ha!  But first, for your Earth custom of &quot;show and tell,&quot; I will exhibit some of our terrifying weaponry.  Snekk blog u-lar mekhh!  Gahghh!  Rk!  Miss Wormwood:  All right, Calvin, that&#39;s quite enough.  Kid:  Miss Wormwood, shouldn&#39;t he be in some special school or something?

Hobbes: This is so stupid. The end of the Mesozoic era...a herd of  Chasmosaurs is unusually jittery. They now know they have more to fear than Tyrannosaurs! Now they face an even greater danger...Tyrannosaurs in F-14s!!

Calvin:  I didn&#39;t make any.  See.  In order to improve oneself, one must have some idea of what&#39;s &quot;good.&quot;  That implies certain values.  But as we all know, values are relative.  Every system of belief is equally valid and we need to tolerate diversity.  Virtue isn&#39;t &quot;better&quot; than vice.  It&#39;s just different.  Hobbes:  I don&#39;t know if I can tolerate that much tolerance.  Calvin:  I refuse to be victimized by notions of virtuous behavior.

I&#39;m one of the greatest people who ever lived!  How lucky people are to know someone as great as me!  I&#39;m great in so many ways!  In fact, I&#39;m so great that my greatness is...  Susie:  You&#39;re not great!  You&#39;re the most conceited blowhard I&#39;ve ever met!  Calvin:  When you&#39;re great.  People often mistake candor for bragging.

Calvin:  Thanks.  Mom:  If you&#39;ve been looking for Hobbes, he somehow got put in the closet.  I just found him way back in there.  Calvin:  Waiting for me in the closet, eh?  Too bad your little plan was thwarted!!  Hobbes:  Why don&#39;t you hang up your coat yourself.

Is it man&#39;s purpose on Earth to express himself, to bring form to thought, and to discover meaning in experience?  Or is it just something to do when he&#39;s bored?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|1|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/01/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/7bc83320784d01302116001dd8b71c47|626|900|Calvin: I&#39;m bored. Let&#39;s go in.  Hobbes: But we&#39;ve only been out here a few minutes.  Calvin: This is taking too long.  Hobbes: What&#39;s the hurry? We&#39;ve got all day!  Calvin: Yeah, but it&#39;s kind of cold, and the sun&#39;s too bright, and my gloves are getting wet. And when you think about it, building a snowman is a lot of work. I didn&#39;t come out here to do something hard. Besides, what if the snowman doesn&#39;t come out very good? We&#39;d be failures! Who wants to be a failure?! Or even if it&#39;s good, what&#39;s the point? It&#39;s just going to melt in a few weeks anyway! It&#39;s all futile! So instead of wasting my time, I&#39;m going to go inside, pull down the shades, and watch TV. That way, in complete physical comfort, I can vicariously experience the activity of actors pretending to do things!  Hobbes: Are you sure it&#39;s not too much trouble to turn on the TV?  Calvin: That&#39;s why we have a remote control.  Hobbes: Virtual reality is already here.  Calvin: I can&#39;t believe the only way to get inside is by walking.

Could the next victim be you??  We&#39;ll get the story from the living rooms of sobbing, hysterical relatives and we&#39;ll tell you why you should be paralyzed with helpless fear!  That&#39;s eyewitness action news!  It&#39;s what you need to know!

I&#39;ll dedicate my career to the proposition that man can reshape the universe according to his own whims.  I&#39;ll probably go into genetic engineering and create new life forms.  Hobbes:  You want to play God?  Calvin:  Not exactly.  God never bothered to patent his stuff.

I&#39;m freezing! Hobbes: You need a nice fur coat like mine. I&#39;m all toasty. Calvin: I&#39;ll just put my feet on your back. Ok? Ooh, you are warm!  Hobbes: Gaaa!  Calvin: quit thrashing around! You&#39;re letting in cold air! Hobbes: Well keep your icy feet on your own side of the bed then! Calvin: They were! Your big behind was on my side! Hobbes: That&#39;s your side! This is the demilitarized zone and this is my side! Calvin: All that! No way, you hog! In fact, the whole bed is my side!  Animals should sleep on the floor! Hobbes: Oh, that does it! You and your hairless pink monkey suit can freeze solid! I&#39;m leaving! Calvin: Come back here! I&#39;ll get you! Gimme that! ...Now where&#39;d he go??  Aaaaaaa   Dad: Gaaaaa!  Somebody&#39;s feet are like ice!! Calvin: If it&#39;s too crowded, you guys are welcome to sleep downstairs. Mom: Calvin had another nightmare.

They&#39;re the type of days when you should just give in, put your pajamas back on, make some hot chocolate, and read comic books in bed with the covers up until the world looks more encouraging.  Calvin:  Of course, they never let you do that.  Hobbes:  Is today one of those days?  Calvin:  It sure is!!

Hobbes:  So you&#39;d only go to school on sunny days?  Calvin:  Well no, on sunny days the judge would let you play outside.  Hobbes:  He&#39;s quite a guy.  Calvin:  He&#39;d make you go to school if it was hot, hazy, and humid with a lot of bugs.

What&#39;s 7+6?  Susie:  Three hundred billion gazillion.  Calvin:  Oh, thanks for the big help!  Susie:  That&#39;s a three, followed by 85 zeroes.  Calvin:  Ah!  I knew that.

I&#39;ll spout simplistic opinions for hours on end, ridicule anyone who disagrees with me, and generally foster divisiveness, cynicism, and a lower level of public dialog!  Hobbes:  It would seem you were born for  the job.  Calvin:  Imagine getting paid to act like a six-year-old!

Obviously I&#39;ve tapped into some primeval well of the human psyche.

I unraveled a hanger and poked it out the back of my pants to make a tailhook!  Now, with a rope stretched across the doorway, I can blast into a room at top speed, and the hook will grab the rope and stop me before I crash out the window on the opposite wall!  Well??  Don&#39;t just sit there, man!  Get out some patent applications!  I wonder how many fortunes he&#39;s let slip through his fingers.

Hobbes:  Smart thinking.  Calvin:  I call this, &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase.&quot;

I wish I could just take a pill to be perfect and I wish I could just push a button to have anything I want.  Hobbes:  The American Dream lives on.  Calvin:  Why should I have to work for everything?!  It&#39;s like saying I don&#39;t deserve it!

Wow, the last two hours really flew by!  I hope the teacher didn&#39;t say anything important.

Wailing helplessly, Moe tumbled head over heels down the smoking chasm until he splashed into the molten magma at the planet&#39;s core, where he slowly melted before igniting in a spitting fireball of grease!

We&#39;ll each make a snowman and have them shaking hands.  Hobbes: Great.  Calvin: This will be very inspirational! People will weep to see two snowmen overcoming their differences and cooperating! Soon we&#39;ll be rolling in public commissions!  Hobbes: Make your snowman&#39;s arm longer.  His hand won&#39;t reach my snowman&#39;s hand.  Calvin: Why should I make a new arm? Just make yours longer.  Hobbes: Then it will look like my snowman had to reach farther than yours did. They should be equal.  Calvin: Then build your snowman closer over here!  Hobbes: I&#39;m not going to start all over! Just make your arm longer!  Calvin: I refuse! You can&#39;t tell me what to do!  Hobbes: In that case, my snowman refuses to shake with your snowman!  Calvin: So what!! My snowman won&#39;t even talk to yours! I&#39;m turning his head the other way!  Hobbes: Ha! While he&#39;s looking over there, my snowman will kick your snowman in his big white butt!  Calvin: Oh yeah?! Well mine knocks your snowman&#39;s head off!  Hobbes: Fine! My snowman feeds your snowman his own nose!  Calvin / Hobbes: Why you !! Leggo!  Stop it!  Oof  Hobbes: I don&#39;t think this sculpture is very good.  Calvin: It&#39;s a compromise.

I don&#39;t remember a door being here before.  Mom puppet: Here&#39;s your breakfast!  Calvin: M-mom?? Mom puppet: Eat up! Mmm! It looks yummy!  Calvin: Y-you&#39;re not my mom!  Mom puppet: Yes I am! Eat your oatmeal!  Calvin: What&#39;s going on?? This isn&#39;t my house and you&#39;re not my mom!!  Oh no! That&#39;s not our yard outside! It&#39;s...it&#39;s a cage!  AAUGHH!  I&#39;m trapped in a lab and they&#39;re trying to get me to imprint on my own species before they return me to the wild!  Alien 1: He&#39;s on to us, Wayne.  Wayne: There goes our funding.  Mom: Here&#39;s your breakfast. What&#39;s the matter?  Calvin: Prove you&#39;re my mom.

I have to say, I&#39;m not entirely comfortable holding a piece of my own head.

Hobbes:  Wow!  Calvin:  So I got an idea.  I poured plaster over the tooth to make a mold, and now I&#39;m casting duplicate teeth.  I&#39;ll put one under the pillow every night, and by the end of the year, I&#39;ll have over 150 dollars!  Hobbes:  Do you think the tooth fairy will believe your mouth had 300 teeth in it?  Calvin:  If she&#39;d rather have an old tooth than 50 cents, how bright can she be?

See, this snowman is in a snow car and he says, &quot;Darn it, the engine froze up!&quot;  Ha ha ha ha!  Get it??  Hobbes:  But if the car is made of snow, the engine would melt if it wasn&#39;t frozen.  Either way, it wouldn&#39;t run.

Therefore, in recognition of my supreme power, you must worship me!  Yes, bow before mighty Calvin and tremble, for I am the eternal, all knowing...

I never threw that!  You can&#39;t prove I threw it!  Besides.  I missed didn&#39;t I?!  The defendant petitions the court for a new trial, on the grounds that his lawyer is incompetent.

Phone:  Is your mother there?  Calvin:  Who&#39;s calling??  Is this about me?!  &#39;Cause if it is, I didn&#39;t do it!  You got nothing on me, understand?!  You can&#39;t prove anything!  I tell you I&#39;m innocent!  Just give up!  You&#39;ll never get me!  Oh, here mom, it&#39;s for you.  Mom:  Hi, can I call you back?  Calvin:  Go ahead and talk.  I cleared it.  It&#39;s cool.

I love the smell of a fire on a cold winter day.  Isn&#39;t it strange how smells are so evocative, but we can&#39;t describe them?  Hobbes:  Oh, I dunno.  That fire has a snorky, brambish smell.  Calvin:  I should have known animals would have words for smells.  Hobbes:  It&#39;s a little brunky, but the humidity affects that.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|2|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/02/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/a64bbb70e0670131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  You&#39;re telling me that animals have their own words for specific smells?  Hobbes:  Well sure.  Calvin:  Ok, what&#39;s the word for how wet leaves smell?  Hobbes:  &#39;Snippid.&#39;  Calvin:  What&#39;s the word for how I smell?  Hobbes:  &quot;Terrible.&quot;

Does it glamorize violence?  Sure.  Does it desensitize us to violence?  Of course.  Does it help us tolerate violence?  You bet.  Does it stunt our empathy for our fellow beings?  Heck yes.  Does it cause violence?...Well, that&#39;s hard to prove.  The trick is to ask the right question.

Hobbes:  Does your magnanimity know no bounds?  Calvin:  Genius has its obligations.  Hey, how do you spell &quot;boogers&quot;?

Calvin:  Yes, but I find that term demeaning and sexist.  Hobbes:  What do you want to be called then?  Calvin:  A &quot;chromosomally advantaged youth.&quot;  Hobbes:  That may not catch on.

Calvin:  How about some dried-up prunes and a root canal?  Dad:  Dried prunes!  Do we have some??

Off we go-o!!  Wheeeeeee aaaaaaaa Whoaaaaa Waaugh!  I think that was our best ride ever!  Hobbes: I kept closing my eyes.  Let&#39;s do it again.

But until I decide to do that, I&#39;ll walk!

Hobbes:  Are you kidding?  Your fingernails are a joke, you&#39;ve got no fangs, you can&#39;t see at night, your pink hides are ridiculous, your reflexes are nil, and you don&#39;t even have tails!  Of course people aren&#39;t content!  Calvin:  Forget I said anything.  Hobbes:  Now if tigers weren&#39;t content, that would be something to wonder about.

Homework makes me happy.  I don&#39;t want to go outside.  I want to do math problems.  BLEHHH!  My brain always rejects attitude transplants.

The women are indecisive whiners, nagging shrews, and bimbos!  And the men are no better.  They&#39;re befuddled morons, heavy drinkers, gluttons, and lazy goof-offs!  Everyone is incompetent, unappreciated, and unsuccessful!  What kind of insidious social programming is this?!  No wonder the world&#39;s such a mess!  I demand politically correct, morally uplifting role models in the funnies.  Dad:  Yes, we all know how funny good role models are.  Calvin:  And look, all the kids are obnoxious brats!

You could break it off your face and have a 3-D sculpture of your sneeze!  ...Well, I think it would be cool.  Hobbes:  People wonder why cats are solitary.

Want any?  Ted:  No thanks, Frank.  Coworkers:  Aieee! They got Frank! Run!  Deer: You got &#39;im!  He&#39;s a big one, too!  Nice shot, Bamb!  Somebody get the camera!  Calvin: ...Needless to say, Frank&#39;s family was upset when he didn&#39;t come home that night. But everybody understood that the human population had doubled in just two generations to almost six billion, so some thinning of the herds was necessary to prevent starvation.  Mom: Another parent-teacher conference.  Dad: Your turn.

Answer:  Let&#39;s be honest.  You&#39;re asking me about Concord?  I rely on the bus driver to find my own house from here.  Concord could be on Neptune for all I know.  And what happened 220 years ago??  I&#39;m a kid.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on now.  I don&#39;t have a shred of context for any of this.  It&#39;s hopeless, Miss Wormwood, hopeless.  Calvin:  We both try to demoralize each other.

Hobbes:  A comic book?  Calvin:  This is the issue where they introduce the arch-villain &quot;Deathmeister&quot;!  In a few years, a rare mint copy of this will be worth millions of dollars!  Needless to say, I bought five copies, sealed them in airtight plastic bags, and put them in a box in the closet, where the light and humidity won&#39;t affect their precious pages!  Hobbes:  How will these be rare and valuable if every kid in America has five copies?  Calvin:  We&#39;re all counting on the other guy&#39;s mom to throw them away.

Dad:  You&#39;d still have to read the book and tell the computer what you want to say, you know.  Calvin:  Man.  What&#39;s all the fuss about computers?!

Hobbes:  What is it?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a writer&#39;s block!  You put it on top of your desk and then you can&#39;t write there any more.  I must be years ahead of my time.

You look down in the dumps.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t have a hairy chest.  Mom says some babes don&#39;t care.  Hobbes:  Thptpbt!  Right.

Susie: Um, OK, thank you. Calvin: Well? What have you got to say for yourself? Hobes: When one entertains female firends, one should try not to look quite as seedy as certain unnamed parties habitually do. Calvin: Who&#39;s entertaining?! Who&#39;s a female friend? Who looks seedy?! Hobbes: A spotted tie is just the thing when you&#39;re wearing stripes! Tigers have a natural flair for casual chic! Calvin: I can&#39;t believe this! Why didn&#39;t you kill her when she came in the door?! Hobbes: By the way, if you had made proper introductins, we might have smooched her hand. Calvin: Here, let me adjust the narrow end of your tie about eight inches.

Hobbes: Oyez! Oyez! Calvin: As we&#39;re all aware, the enemy has infiltrated our territory and is spreading disiformatin to the effect that homework ought to be done right after school! As my mom may have covert girl sympathies, we must eradicate the hostile forces1 Any questions? Hobbes: Yes, could we poke some air holes in here? Calvin: Too risky. The box of secrecy must remain secure!

All we value is ruthless efficiency, and I say we deny our own humanity that way! Without an appreciatin for grace and beauty, there&#39;s no pleasure in creating things and no pleasure in having them! Our lives are made drearier, rather than richer! How can a person take pride in his work when skill and care are considered luxuries1 We&#39;re not machines! We have a human need for craftsmanship!

We don&#39;t notice the small stuff and we&#39;re never prepared for the big stuff. Hobbes: What about the stuff in between? Calvin: That stuff&#39;s boring. Hobbes: Let&#39;s hope bumbling along without a clue is important. Calvin: According to the ads, fresh breath and dry armpits are crucial.

I couldn&#39;t even turn myself over1 My eyes wouldn&#39;t focus! I couldn&#39;t do anything! Think of al the work it took to develop the motor skills necessar to hold a crayon, to place the tip of it on a page, and to move it in predetermined, coordinated motions! This picture is the result of six years&#39; unrelenting toil! A lifetime of effort went into this! Dad: I&#39;m still not paying you $500 for it. Calvin: It will appreciate! It&#39;s an investment!

Boy, this is unpleasant! Stupid, miserable wind! What lousy weather! What an awful day! Hobbes: Well if you can&#39;t change it, what&#39;s the point in griping about it?

Calvin: It&#39;s too blue. It needs some red. Hobbes: Red? Calvin: Just a little, right over there. Hang on. That&#39;s better. Hobbes: Well I&#39;ll be!

The universe just goes out forever and ever!  Hobbes: It kind of makes you wonder why man considers himself such a big screaming deal.  Calvin: That&#39;s why we stay inside with our appliances.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|4|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/04/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f0961ee0e0670131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  This new issue of chewing magazine tells how to set up a mandibular fitness regime!  Basically, they recommend interval training: chewing one piece of gum with lots of reps, followed by chewing five pieces of gum at once, so you really work the masseter and buccinator muscles.  It&#39;s a grueling workout, but you build strength and endurance, so you can come through in a clincher.  Hobbes:  I&#39;m sure the glory makes it all worthwhile.  Calvin:  Plus, you develop that &quot;chewer&#39;s jaw&quot; that drives the girls wild.

Calvin: I&#39;m doing stretches. Chewing Magazine says you should always warm up before yo chew gum. Did you know that neglecting to stretch the temoralis muscles is the leading cause of gum chewing injuries? Hobbes: What about falling down while chewing and walking? Calvin: With a good helmet, the risk is surprisingly small.

This jersey is made with Swet-tek fibers that wick away perspiration!  The mesh collar keeps your sternomastoids venilated and zippered pockets hold spare gum and wrappers!  Hobbes:  Why is it covered with brand logos?  Calvin:  That gives you the psychological edge of pretending you&#39;re sponsored.  Hobbes:  How can you tell you&#39;re reading an advertisement, a product review, or the product itself?  Calvin:  I&#39;d sure like to be a walking endorsement.

Hobbes:  What for?  Calvin:  To make sure I&#39;m chewing at my aerobic threshold!  Every day I want to see that I&#39;m chewing more gum faster, harder, and longer!  Hobbes:  What&#39;s the point of attaching a number to everything you do?  Calvin:  If your numbers go up, it means you&#39;re having more fun.  Hobbes:  Science to the spirit&#39;s rescue once again.

This is the only life I&#39;ve got!!  AAAAAAAAAAAA!  Miss Wormwood:  Next time, try a drink of water and a few deep breaths.

A trickle of water running through some dirt!  I&#39;d say our afternoon just got booked solid!

I, for example, take great pleasure in being right here, right now, doing what we&#39;re doing.  Hobbes:  Of course, you&#39;re supposed to be at school.  Calvin:  I couldn&#39;t appreciate those moments.

Dad:  Because it&#39;s bad enough we have a telephone.  Calvin:  HELLLPPP!!

You wait forever to get to the top and then the ride is over so fast.  And if you sit for a moment to enjoy the height, everybody yells at you to get going.  And sometimes the idiot behind you starts down too soon and he smacks into you at the bottom before you can get away.  Yep, the playground is a lot more fun after class starts.  Person:  CALVIN!

Mom:  I&#39;m cutting up an onion.  Calvin:  It must be hard to cook if you anthropomorphize your vegetables.

Calvin:  Yes Miss Wormwood.  I would be hap-py to do an-y-thing you ask.  I have been suc-cess-ful-ly pro-grammed to obey all di-rec-tives.  I have no will of my own...my own...my own...my own.  Doesn&#39;t anybody appreciate theater?!

Mom:  No, not until you&#39;re older.  Calvin:  I&#39;m old enough!  I could do it!  Mom:  Well, maybe just this once, if you do a real good job.  Calvin:  That suppressed smile worries me.

His genius is urgently required on a top secret matter of national security.  Sincerely, the President of the United States.  P.S.  Really.&quot;  Nice try.  Sit down.  Calvin:  I gotta learn how to write in cursive.

Dad:  Grown-ups can only justify playing outside by calling it exercise, doing it when they&#39;d rather not, and keeping records to quantify their performance.  Calvin:  That sounds like a job.  Dad:  ...except you don&#39;t get paid.  Calvin:  So play is worse than work?  Dad:  Being grown-up is tough.

I need more excitement.  So today, I&#39;m going to have a new kind of cereal!  Hobbes:  This cereal doesn&#39;t have any chocolate frosting.  It has fiber and raisins.  Calvin:  Of course, a big part of life is horrifying surprise.  Routines can be comforting.  Hobbes:  We tigers prefer to inflict excitement on others.

After I wait ten minutes, they open a new line for all the people behind me who have waited two minutes.  I&#39;m waiting to pay, and the cashier puts me on hold instead of the person on the telephone.  Cashier:  Have a nice day.  Mom:  Too late.

People look like slobs everywhere they go.  Dad:  Everybody&#39;s rude, too.  People swear all the time, and you can forget about being addressed as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Sir.&quot;  There&#39;s no respect for anyone.  Calvin:  How come I gotta change the world?!

We get up at the crack of dawn, watch cartoons and eat sugary cereal until we fight, and then mom throws us out of the house.  It never changes.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s what I like about Saturdays too!  Calvin:  First one downstairs gets to pick the cartoons!

Hobbes: Well, you&#39;ve done all you can do.

Calvin:  No, why?  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Look at it.  It&#39;s chewed up.  You should take care of your equipment.  Calvin:  The ball did this!  It&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to tell you!  These are fang marks!  That ball is berserk!  It&#39;s deranged!  It&#39;s a menace!  Why do I even bother?

Let go of me, you malevolent, murderous moron!!  Hobbes: It&#39;s morning! Now we can do stuff again! C&#39;mon! Whee! Calvin: It&#39;s hard to be mad at someone who misses you while you&#39;re asleep.

I say anything new is good by definition!  It can shock, insult, or offend me, so long as it doesn&#39;t bore me!  If you can&#39;t give me something new, then repackage the old so it looks new!  Novelty is all that matters!  I won&#39;t pay attention if it&#39;s not fresh and different!  Hobbes:  I see why timeless truth doesn&#39;t sell.  Calvin:  Give me a good flash in the pan any day.

The escalators there had wood stairs, and they used to click, clack, and creak.  The wood slats on each step were maybe half an inch apart, and I always wondered if ladies got their high heels stuck and got pulled under.  Some of those escalators were very narrow--just wide enough for one person.  Yep, those old escalators had a lot more personality than these slick metal ones.  Calvin:  I&#39;d hate to think that all my current experiences will someday become stories with no point.

When you get something, it&#39;s new and exciting.  When you have something, you take it for granted and it&#39;s boring.  Hobbes:  But everything you get turns into something you have.  Calvin:  That&#39;s why you always need to get new things!  Hobbes: I feel like I&#39;m in some stockholder&#39;s dream.  Calvin:  &quot;Waste and want,&quot; that&#39;s my motto.

Worker 2: Me too! Why doesn&#39;t anyone ever clean this dump?  Worker 1: Here&#39;s a movie reel. I suppose it&#39;s as good as any.  Worker 2: I grabbed these two. Let&#39;s get back to central cognition.  Worker 1: We can run this reel first.  I hope these are better than last night&#39;s movies.  Worker 2: Hurry up! The lights are dimming! Help me thread the projector!  Worker 3: Yikes, this is awful! Where did you guys find this?  Worker 1: Oops, the next reel isn&#39;t even from the same film.  Worker 2: Good! Put it on!  Worker 1: This one is even worse! I guess it&#39;s some sort of suspense movie.  Worker 3: Why can&#39;t we ever watch anything good?  Worker 2: Maybe you should get the movies next time!  Worker 1: Aughh! Monsters! Monsters! Turn it off!  Worker 2: Too scary! Quick, try another reel! Worker 1: This one makes no sense! What&#39;s going on? Has this been dubbed from some other language?  Worker 2: None of these make sense! We&#39;re splicing them all out of order.  Worker 3: What a waste of time!  Worker 1: The lights are coming back on! Show&#39;s over!  Worker 2: Finally, I thought this would never end.  Worker 3: Back to work! Man your stations! Full alert!  Calvin: Whoo, I had so many strange dreams... I wonder what they mean.

Do you know?  Susie Derkins (friend):  Mr.  Kneecapper.  Oh no!  Really?  I heard he killed a kid last year!  Susie Derkins (friend):  What?!  Calvin:  Yeah, some kid was talking in class, so Mr. Kneecapper took him out in the hall and there were strange lumps in the cafeteria meatloaf that afternoon!  Susie Derkins (friend):  Ohh!  Calvin:  Wait till she sees what&#39;s on today&#39;s lunch menu.

For example, right now, instead of waiting for the school bus, I could stick out my thumb, hitch a ride, and spend the rest of my life in the Serengeti, migrating with the wildebeests!  Hobbes:  The Serengeti is in Africa.  You couldn&#39;t really hitch a ride there.  Calvin:  Life is full of precluded possibilities.

Calvin:  I&#39;m looking for buried treasure!  Hobbes:  What have you found?  Calvin:  A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.  Hobbes:  On your first try??  Calvin:  There&#39;s treasure everywhere!

What bizarre occurrence will our hero be the first to witness? Calvin: The suspense! Calvin:...Our hero chucks a few rocks... Calvin: .Sighhh Hobbes: If you couldn&#39;t find any weirdness, maybe we&#39;ll just have to make some! Hobbes: Now yer talkin&#39;!

I&#39;ve got a big owwy boo boo on my pinky.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  That&#39;s too bad.  Calvin:  When your ailments sound cute, you don&#39;t get much sympathy.

I added it up and figured out I spend an average of four days a year taking baths!  Four full days--morning, noon, and night--just sitting in the stupid bathtub!  What could possibly be a bigger waste of time than that?!  Hobbes:  How long did it take you to add this all up?

What&#39;s the colony done for you lately?  What about your needs?  You don&#39;t owe anybody anything!  Let the others fend for themselves!  Move out!  Discover yourself!  Express your individuality!  If they listen, this should solve our ant problem.

Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Because it&#39;s cold.  Ice wants to get warm, so it goes to the top of liquids in order to be nearer to the sun.  Calvin:  Is that true?  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Look it up and find out.  Calvin:  I should just look stuff up in the first place.  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  You can learn a lot, talking to me.

What do you say I take some time and help you learn how to ride it?  Calvin:  NO-O-O-O-O-O!!  Dad:  You&#39;re welcome.  Calvin:  Mom!  Mom!  Dad hates me!

It&#39;s not going anywhere.  I can feel it&#39;s going to throw me!  Get ready to yank it&#39;s wheels off!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Just relax.  I&#39;ve got you.  Calvin:  How can I relax?!  I&#39;m uninsured and unarmed!  I&#39;m as good as dead!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Push back on the pedals.  That&#39;s your brake, ok?  Calvin:  Yes, well, that was fun!  Thanks for the lesson!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Get back here.  Calvin:  No, really, I think I&#39;ve got it!  You can sell the bike now.

Calvin:  AAA!  No momentum!  No momentum!  Dad:  Just pedal slowly.  I&#39;m holding the bike, so you won&#39;t fall.  Calvin:  You&#39;ll let go and the bike will launch me into the ionosphere!  Dad:  Trust me, ok?  Calvin:  Trust you?  I hardly know you!  Dad:  I&#39;m your father!!  Calvin:  What, for six years?!  When I&#39;m 40, we&#39;ll see how things are going!

Your balance will be better if you&#39;re loose.  Calvin:  I can&#39;t help it!  Imminent death makes me tense!  I admit it!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  You need a goal.  Concentrate on your goal.  Calvin:  My goal is to dismantle this bicycle and mail every piece to a different country so it can never be rebuilt!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Ok, that&#39;s not a good goal.  Calvin:  Well I&#39;m not changing it!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|6|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/06/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/339389b0e0680131732c005056a9545d|293|900|Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Think about the places you can go once you learn how to ride!  Think about how impressed your friends will be!  Think about how much fun you&#39;ll have!  Think about inhaling.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|6|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/06/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/34df2240e0680131732c005056a9545d|292|900|Hobbes:  Ooh, it doesn&#39;t look like the bike lesson went so good.  Calvin:  It didn&#39;t.  Dad likes riding his bike!  He doesn&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like for me!  I hate flipping over the bars, getting chased around the yard, and getting mowed down by a demonic machine!  Hobbes:  Is that what happened?  Calvin:  No, I tripped coming up the stairs.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|6|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/06/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/de1646c0784d01302116001dd8b71c47|631|900|Door bell: Ding dong   Calvin: I&#39;m coming. I&#39;m coming. Aaaa!  I opened the door and my bike got in!!  Hellpp! Run for your lives!! It&#39;s an unbalanced bicycle!! Someone get me a spoke wrench! Hehh hoo hehh hoo.  Back! Back!  Ha! You can&#39;t get me now! Mom: Aiee! Tire tracks on the rugs! Oil on the couch!  Dad: Where&#39;s that kid?! Calvin: Someday the neighbors will look out and wonder why there&#39;s a grown man wearing kids clothes on our roof.

Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  It means you join your friends, get some cheap beer, order a pizza, and forget about tomorrow.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  That&#39;s not what it means!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Where did you go to college?  Calvin:  Never mind.

A curious shadow falls over downtown! Dad: Why does he build everything so close to the water? It&#39;s stupid.  Mom: He doesn&#39;t seem to mind doing it over and over.

Mom got me a book from the library.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s nice.  Calvin:  Nice?!?  It&#39;s summer!  I only get three short months to goof off!  I&#39;m not going to waste these precious days reading books!  Summers are for vegetating!  That&#39;s why the TV shows are reruns and the movies are sequels!  Hobbes:  No wonder the flies come out.  Calvin:  Heck, everyone knows it&#39;s not entertainment unless you can sit in the dark and eat.

Hobbes:  Is it good?  Do you like it? Is it exciting?  Are you having fun?   Hobbes:  Shh.  Calvin:  How could it possibly be fun when it&#39;s so quiet?!?

Hobbes:  Ok.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll be having the time of my life, while you&#39;ll be sitting here yawning and wishing you were...  I&#39;ll just kind of read over your shoulder, ok?  Hobbes:  No.  Go do something fun.

Mom:  What did you think of it?  Calvin:  It really made me see things differently.  It&#39;s given me a lot to think about.  Mom:  I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.  Calvin:  It&#39;s complicating my life.  Don&#39;t get me any more.

The secret to getting donations is to depict everyone who disagrees with you as the enemy.  Then you explain how they&#39;re systematically working to destroy everything you hold dear.  It&#39;s a war of values!  Rational discussion is hopeless!  Compromise is unthinkable!  Our only hope is well-funded antagonism, so we need your money to keep up the fight!  Hobbes:  How cynically unconstructive.  Calvin:  Enmity sells.

Calvin:  A water balloon right in the kisser!  Hobbes:  You take their money and then soak them with a water balloon??  Calvin:  Right.  Hobbes:  Whose happiness are we talking about?  Calvin:  Who went to all this trouble?!

Hobbes:  ...29...30.  What&#39;s here?  Calvin:  My map shows a big hole.  Hobbes:  Wouldn&#39;t it be faster to make the map conform to the yard?  Calvin:  Are you in some sort of hurry?

Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|7|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/07/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4938b560e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Art isn&#39;t about ideas.  It&#39;s about style.  The most crucial career decision is picking a good &quot;ism&quot; so everyone knows how to categorize you without understanding the work.  Hobbes:  You do goofy drawings on the sidewalk.  Calvin:  Right.  I&#39;m a suburban post-modernist.  Hobbes:  Aren&#39;t we all.  Calvin:  I was going to be a neo-deconstructivist but Mom wouldn&#39;t let me.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|7|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/07/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4a7a1da0e0680131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Times are tough for us suburban post-modernists.  Hobbes:  How so?  Calvin:  Well, people seem to be reluctant to pay for sidewalk drawings that stay where thay are and wash away in the rain.  And nowadays, nobody wants tax money to support art, and corporations won&#39;t underwrite me because I&#39;m not famous enough to effectively advertise their cultural enlightenment.  Hobbes:  Couldn&#39;t you support your art with another job?  Calvin:  What, you mean work?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|7|15|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/07/15|https://assets.amuniversal.com/4bc19e40e0680131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  People always make the mistake of thinking art is created for them.  But really, art is a private language for sophisticates to congratulate themselves on their superiority to the rest of the world.  As my artist&#39;s statement explains, my work is utterly incomprehensible and is therefore full of deep significance.  Hobbes:  You misspelled &quot;Weltanschauung.&quot;  Calvin:  A good artist&#39;s statement says more than his art ever does.

Calvin: A big one! Hobbes: Do you think it&#39;s poisonous? Calvin: Beats me. How can you tell? Hobbes: If it bites you and you die, it&#39;s poisonous. Calvin: Har har.  Hobbes: Look how it glides along. It&#39;s almost like a liquid. Calvin: I wonder how they do that. Hobbes: He&#39;s flicking his tongue out. Calvin: I think that&#39;s how they smell, but why would they smell with a tongue?  Hobbes: Do snakes have eyelids? Do they sleep with their eyes open? Calvin: Don&#39;t snakes eat mice? How could a snake swallow something bigger than it&#39;s own head?  Heck, we don&#39;t know anything about snakes. Hobbes: Maybe your Mom would get us a book. Calvin: Yeah, let&#39;s go see! Hobbes: We&#39;ll be experts! We&#39;ll learn all there is to know! Calvin: Hey, wait a minute! It&#39;s summer! I&#39;m on vacation! I don&#39;t want to learn anything! Hobbes: If nobody makes you do it, it counts as fun.  Calvin: Hmm..you really think so??   Calvin/Hobbes: Coooooollll.

Everything changes.  That&#39;s the one thing we know for sure in this world.  But I&#39;m still going to gripe about it.

I have the right to do whatever I want, all the time!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  No you don&#39;t.  Calvin:  I don&#39;t?  Well it sure ought to be a right.

No, my dad&#39;s not here right now.  Will I take a message?  I don&#39;t know--what&#39;s in it for me?  People always assume you&#39;re some kind of altruist.

I am the Downill Tumble and Roll champ, King of the Toad Finders, Captain of the High Altitude Tree Branch Vista Club, second place finisher in the &#39;Round the Backyard Dash, Premier Burper State Division, Sodbuster and Worm Scout First Order, and Generalissimo of the Mud and Mayhem Society!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Busy day?  Calvin:  About usual.  Want to hear what Hobbes is?

Because it&#39;s entertaining, that&#39;s why!  If warped values are the price of a vicarious thrill, so be it!  Let the business respond to consumer demand!  Hobbes:  The customer is always right.  Calvin:  Shock and titillate me!  I&#39;ve got money!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|7|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/07/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/57ddeff0e0680131732c005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  Popular culture isn&#39;t to blame for selling twisted values.  Movies, records, and TV shows reflect the reality of our times.  Artists depict hatred and violence because that&#39;s what they see.  Hobbes:  Why don&#39;t they see things of beauty and value?  Because boring stuff doesn&#39;t sell.  Hobbes:  Such vision and integrity.  Calvin:  There&#39;s nothing like a good gunfight to uplift the spirit.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|7|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/07/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/596bf550e0680131732c005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  Another thing to remember about popular culture is that today&#39;s TV-reared audience is hip and sophisticated.  This stuff doesn&#39;t affect us.  We can seperate fact from fiction.  We understand satire and irony.  We&#39;re detached and jaded viewers who aren&#39;t influenced by what we watch.  Hobbes:  I think I hear advertisers laughing.  Calvin:  Hold on, I need to inflate my basketball shoes.

The dizzy way they zip around, the high-pitched noise they make, their pesky size...everything about them is annoying!  Hobbes:  ...Said the hyperactive, whiny, small child.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|7|29|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/07/29|https://assets.amuniversal.com/5e008e90e0680131732c005056a9545d|286|900|Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  I want you to pick up your room today, ok?  Calvin:  Do I get paid?  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  No.  Calvin:  If I don&#39;t get paid, how do I know it&#39;s important?!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  You can trust a mother on that.

We look for meaning in everything we do. But suppose there is no meaning! Suppose life is fundamentally absurd! Suppose there&#39;s no reason or truth or rightness in anything! What is nothing means anything? What if nothing really matters? Hobbes: I guess there&#39;s no harm in a little wishful thinking.  Calvin: Or suppose everything matters. which would be worse??

Your water balloon is long and floppy, impossible to throw the slightest distance!  The advantage is clearly mine!  Do you surrender?

My toast will get cold while I get another stick from the fridge!  Haven&#39;t I suffered enough??  Where will it all end?!?  Mr. and Mrs. Empathy.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|8|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/08/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/6290bf40e0680131732c005056a9545d|286|900|Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting some exercise.

I can put things together!  I can knock things apart!  I can alter my environment at will and make an incredible din all the while!  Ah, it&#39;s great to be male!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|8|4|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/08/04|https://assets.amuniversal.com/65690980e0680131732c005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  Vampire bugs!  Run for your life!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  They&#39;re called mosquitos.  Calvin:  So if they drink your blood, you don&#39;t turn into one?

It&#39;s like an interception in football!  You grab the other guy&#39;s idea and run the opposite way with it!  The more sentences you complete, the higher your score!  The idea is to block the other guy&#39;s thoughts and express your own!  That&#39;s how you win!  Hobbes:  Conversations aren&#39;t contests!  Calvin:  Ok, a point for you, but I&#39;m still ahead.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|8|6|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/08/06|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f8bb4d10784d01302116001dd8b71c47|603|900|Calvin: Oh boy! It&#39;s bedtime! Mom: Bedtime. Let&#39;s go. Calvin: Aww. I hate getting ready for bed.

When you&#39;re actually confronted with the stillness of nature, it&#39;s kind of startling.  Hobbes:  Why, you can even hear yourself think.  Calvin:  This is making me nervous.  Let&#39;s go in.

We don&#39;t believe in things we can&#39;t see.  So how do we know that no-see-ums exist?  Verification is ruled out by definition!  It&#39;s an ontological quandary.  Hobbes:  Hold still a moment.  Calvin:  Ooh, I itch!  Hobbes:  Glad I could help.

Calvin:  Aww mom, It&#39;s not even dark yet!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  I didn&#39;t say it was.  I said it&#39;s time to come in.  Calvin:  It&#39;s a cruel season that makes you get ready for bed while it&#39;s light out.

Some people are idealists, standing for principle and refusing to compromise.  And some people just act on any whim that enters their heads.  Hobbes:  I wonder which you are.  Calvin:  I pragmatically turn my whims into principles!

Hobbes:  I notice that all of them involve deep-fat frying.  Calvin:  I&#39;m adding a chocolate syrup section now.

Pretty ingenious, huh?  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll bet the towel comes in handy.  Calvin:  Why?

Now, with modems, faxes, and car phones, everybody wants everything instantly!  Improved technology just increases expectations.  these machnes don&#39;t make life easier--they make life more harassed.  Calvin:  Six minutes to microwave this??  Who&#39;s got that kind of time?!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  If we wanted more leisure, we&#39;d invent machines that do things less efficiently.

Their dull appearance is part of their scheme. I know of their plans. I know their techniques. My parents are outer space alien freaks! They landed on earth in spaceships humongous. Posing as grownups, they now walk among us. My parents deny this, but I know the truth. They&#39;re here to enslave me and spoil my youth. Early each morning, as the sun rises, Mom and Dad put on their earthling disguises. I knew right away their masks weren&#39;t legit. Their faces are lined - they sag and don&#39;t fit. The earth&#39;s gravity makes them sluggish and slow. They say not to run, wherever I go. They live by the clock. They&#39;re slaves to routines, They work the year &#39;round. They&#39;re almost machines. They deny that TV and fried food have much worth. They cannot be human. They&#39;re not of this earth. I cannot escape their alien gaze, and they&#39;re warping my mind with their alien ways. For, sinister plots, this one is a gem. They&#39;re bringing me up to turn me into them!

Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Sure.  What for?  Calvin:  A wick.  I&#39;m saving all my ear wax to make a candle.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Oh Calvin!  Blaughh!  Calvin:  Could I make a set of crayons?

See, they asked how much money I spend on gum each week, so I wrote, &quot;$500.&quot;  For my age I put &quot;43,&quot; and when they asked what my favorite flavor is, I wrote &quot;garlic/curry.&quot;  Hobbes:  This magazine should have some amusing ads soon.  Calvin:  I love messing with data.

They talk on the phone while they drive, they watch TV while they eat, they listen to music while they work...  People never focus on any one thing to enfoy it or do it well.  Hobbes:  You&#39;re breaking my concentration.  Calvin:  We focus on doing nothing at all!

Soon school will start.  No more freedom, no more long days outside, no more fun.  Hobbes:  Well, let&#39;s go make the most of the time we have left!  Calvin:  Nah, I&#39;ve reserved the rest of the month for moping.

Ukh hudgablukk Spiff!  Spiff! Blecckh Blecckh! Spaceman Spiff: We join our hero, the courageous Spaceman Spiff, as he flees the awful bug beings of Zartron-9! Spiff&#39;s only chance is a daring strategy of head-to-head combat! Our hero swings around and readies his computer-guided death ray blaster! Tum te tum tum..I wish this booted up faster.  C&#39;mon c&#39;mon. There we go. Let&#39;s see, get the &quot;file&quot; icon..Double click on &quot;blaster&quot;...Hmm, pull down &quot;settings&quot;...get the dialog box..click on &quot;rays&quot;...select &quot;death&quot;..Hit &quot;ok&quot;.

Go back to &quot;volts&quot; Highlight &quot;Gazillion; press &quot;delete.&quot; Type in...Spiff is going down!  Dad: Hey, why won&#39;this boot up? Was somebody been playing with this thing?! Calvin: The whole thing went down, Dad. Luckily I jumped clear at the last second.

A quarter!!  Wow!  I&#39;m rich beyond my dreams!  I can have anything I want!  All my prayers have been answered!  Maybe there&#39;s more.

Hobbes:  I&#39;ve always said you&#39;re a friend without pier.  Calvin:  Huh?  Hobbes:  Nothing.  Calvin:  Mm.  Hobbes:  I guess you&#39;re under a lot of pier pressure.  Calvin:  Is something wrong with you?!

Who is out there to inspire us with a personal example of virtue and self-sacrifice in the name of a higher good?  Who can we look up to?  Business leaders?  Sports figures?  Politicians?  Celebrities?  Heck, we&#39;re lucky if they don&#39;t end up in prison!  Hobbes:  Fortunately, if we can&#39;t get inspiration, we&#39;ll accept entertainment.  Calvin:  As usual, the hero business is up to me.

Did it ever occur to you that I have a life beyond this sales pitch and you&#39;re intruding on it?!  There would be more civility in this world if people didn&#39;t take it as an invitation to walk on you.  Calvin:  I&#39;m only civil because I don&#39;t know any swear words.

And we get to eat early and have grilled cheese sandwiches?  This is more like it!  Boy, you look nice.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Thank you.  Calvin:  ...Uh-oh.  Hobbes:  Dibs on the french fries.

Calvin:  Aaa!  No!  I&#39;m not going to bed!  You can&#39;t make me!  Rosalyn (babysitter):  You and I are going to make a deal.  Calvin:  A deal?!  What kind of deal??  I&#39;m not making any deal!  Rosalyn (babysitter):  You don&#39;t give me any trouble tonight, and we&#39;ll play a game.  Calvin:  What&#39;s the game?  &quot;Kill the Kid&quot;?!  No way!  Rosalyn (babysitter):  Plus, you get to stay up half an hour past your bedtime.  Calvin:  Notice how obediently I&#39;m sitting here.

Rosalyn (babysitter):  You can decide.  Pick your favorite game.  Calvin:  Is this a trick?  Can we really play my favorite game??  Rosalyn (babysitter):  Sure, why not?  What is it?  Calvin:  Calvinball!!  Rosalyn (babysitter):  Calvinball??  Calvin:  Get out the time-fracture wickets, Hobbes!  we&#39;re gonna play Calvinball!  Rosalyn (babysitter):  What the heck is Calvinball?

Hobbes:  Oh boy!  Calvin:  Here, you can double-check my math problems while I start on my history.  We&#39;ve got to get this done.  Hobbes:  You finished your math??  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  We&#39;re here to have a nice time.  Try not to think about all the trouble Calvin&#39;s getting into.  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Did you hear that??  It sounded like another siren.

Rosalyn (babysitter):  Great.  Are you ready to play you game then?  Calvin:  First we need to make you a mask.  Rosalyn:  A mask?  What for?  Calvin:  When you play Calvinball, you wear a mask.  Rosalyn (babysitter):  Why?  Calvin:  Sorry, no one&#39;s allowed to question the masks.  Rosalyn (babysitter):  This sounds like a great game.

The ferocious Allosaur is thirsty too! This means confrontation! Ah heh heh..  Calvin: Fortunately this Allosaur is the patient type.  Moe: Don&#39;t make me smack you across the hall, twerp.

They&#39;ve gotta have rules and they gotta keep score!  Calvinball is better by far!  It&#39;s never the same!  It&#39;s always bizarre!  You don&#39;t need a team or a referee!  You know that it&#39;s great, &#39;cause it&#39;s named after me!  If you wanna...  Uh, feel free to harmonize with Hobbes on the rumma tum tums.  Rosalyn (babysitter):  This was a mistake.

Calvin: A decree? Um...OK. Roslyn: I decree you have to catch a water balloon that I throw high in the air. Calvin: Oh NO! Man, she picked up the nuances of this game FAST! Roslyn: Ha! This IS fun!

Rosalyn: Sorry, Calvin, I touched you with the baby sitter flag. Calvin: The baby sitter flag?? What&#39;s that? Rosalyn: It means you must obey the baby sitter...who says it&#39;s a half-hour past your bedtime now. Let&#39;s go in. Calvin: AWWWWW! Darn baby sitter flag.

That&#39;s a good sign. Mom: We&#39;re home! Is everything OK? Rosalyn: Fine. Calvin did his homework, then we played a game, and Calvin went to bed. Dad: It&#39;s awfully late for jokes, Rosalyn. Calvin: I&#39;ve noticed that when you play games with girls, you get captured a lot. Hobbes: Some of us are just irresistible.

The day off is ruined by knowing I&#39;ve got to get ready for school tomorrow.  Hobbes: Why don&#39;t we get your chores done now, so we can enjoy the rest of the day without worry? Calvin: Hmm...I hate to delay fun, but maybe you&#39;re on to something. Hobbes: This will make the fun more fun.  Calvin: At last! we got everything bad out of the way! Mom: There you are. It&#39;s time for bed. Calvin: See if I ever listen to you again!  Hobbes: Never put the low priorities first.

It&#39;s sort of ordinary, I suppose, but I like to have it around. It reminds me that as soon as I save a little money, I&#39;ll buy a ticket and put as much distance between you chumps and me, it will boggle your minds! It&#39;s not an &quot;ATTITUDE,&quot; it&#39;s a FACT!

What distinguishes &quot;lite&quot; from these others? Does the &quot;original flavor&quot; package imply that the others taste different? Frankly, my life was plenty complicated BEFORE the potato chips.

There must be three sizes of five brands of four consistencies! Who demands this much choice?? I know! I&#39;ll quit my job and devote my life to choosing peanut butter! Is &quot;chunky&quot; chunky enough, or do I need &quot;EXTRA chunky&quot;? I&#39;ll compare ingredients! I&#39;ll compare brands! I&#39;ll compare sizes and prices! Maybe I&#39;ll drive around and see what OTHER stores have! So much selection and so little time!  (To Mom): I think YOU should do the shopping. Mom: Did the manager have to talk to you again? Calvin: Hey, where&#39;s the peanut butter?!

Wheeee!  He&#39;s at the 30...the 20...the 10! Nobody can catch him!  Hobbes: Nobody wants to! you&#39;re running toward your own goal! Calvin: Huh? Hobbes: When I learned you were a spy, I switched goals. This is your goal and mine&#39;s hidden! Calvin: Hidden?! Hobbes: You&#39;ll never find it in a million years!  Calvin: I don&#39;t need to find it!  As a traitor to your team, crossing my goal counts as crossing your goal!  Hobbes: Ah, you might think so... Calvin: In fact, I know so!  Hobbes: But the place I hid my goal is right on top of your goal, so the points will go to me! Calvin: But the fact is, I&#39;m really a double agent! I&#39;m on your team after all... Which means you&#39;ll lose points if I cross your goal! Ha ha! But I&#39;m a traitor too, so I&#39;m really on your team! I want you to cross my goal! The points will go to your team, which is really my team! Calvin: That would be true...If I were a football player!  Hobbes: You mean..?  Calvin: I&#39;m actually a badminton player disguised as as a double-agent football player!! Hobbes: And I&#39;m secretly a volleyball-croquet-polo player! Calvin: Sooner or later, all our games turn into Calvinball. Hobbes: No cheating!

Hobbes:  What&#39;s the problem?  Calvin:  The teacher said my book report was terrible and I need to do it over.  Hobbes:  Really??  Calvin:  Obviously, I need a cooler letterhead logo.  Hobbes:  I&#39;ll add more lance-toting tigers around the Calvin shield.

Aaa!  No tissue!  No hanky!  I..ah...ah...ah...  Of my limited options, this was probably the worst.

To survive, Spiff must...find...food! Spiff follows a scavenger mordon! Perhaps there&#39;s a fresh kill nearby! Ughhh! The stench! Our hero becomes a vegitarian on the spot! But the grasses are indigestible! The fruit is poisonous! There is nothing to eat at all! Weak and desparing, Spiff peers into a frozen geyser pit! What&#39;s down there? Ice cream sandwiches! Our hero is saved! Susie: That&#39;s not very healthy. Calvin: I only need to survive until I can escape, our hero mutters grimly.

Miss Wormwood is out to destroy my life!  Hobbes:  What do you have to do?  Calvin:  Make a leaf collection!  What a dumb waste of time!  Hobbes:  How many leaves do you need?  Calvin:  50!  I gotta collect 50 leaves!  And just when I thought of a loophole, the teacher said every leaf has to be a different kind.  Hobbes:  She&#39;s got your number.

Calvin:  In two weeks.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s not so bad.  You just need three or four leaves a day.  Calvin:  I&#39;m not working on weekends.  Hobbes:  Ok, five leaves a day.  Calvin:  And my weekdays are blocked until next Thursday at 6 P.M.!  Hobbes:  So you need 50 leaves an hour.  Calvin:  See??  It&#39;s impossible!

Do you want it for your collection?  Calvin:  No.  Hobbes:  Why not?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a beautiful afternoon!  I&#39;m not going to waste it doing ridiculous busywork for school!  Hobbes:  But this would be one less leaf you&#39;d need to collect later.  Calvin:  Yeah, but it&#39;s one more leaf than I need right now.  Hobbes:  Somehow, it&#39;s always right now until it&#39;s later.  Calvin:  Whatever that means.

Have you started your leaf collection yet?  Calvin:  I&#39;ve been visualizing the conceptualization process.  That&#39;s the hard part.  Susie Derkins (friend):  I&#39;m almost done.  Isn&#39;t it fun?  It&#39;s like a treasure hunt!  Calvin:  A treasure hunt?!?  Are you crazy??  This is a stupid, boring, time-wasting forced assignment!  This isn&#39;t fun!  Susie Derkins (friend):  &quot;When life gives you a lemon, make lemonade.&quot;  Calvin:  I say, when life gives you a lemon, wing it right back and add some lemons of your own!

How could you possibly be almost done?!  Susie Derkins (friend):  I make it a game.  I pretend it&#39;s a contest to see how many leaves I cna find each day.  That way, it&#39;s not an assignment, it&#39;s fun!  Calvin:  Did you know that&#39;s one of the ten warning signs of hopeless dweebism?  Susie Derkins (friend):  I&#39;ll bet another sign is moving to the next grade each year.

Hobbes:  You haven&#39;t even started.  Calvin:  Yeah, but I work better under pressure.  Hobbes:  Actually, you work only under pressure.  Calvin:  That way, the work time is more miserable, but there&#39;s less of it.

Could we go to the arboretum sometime?  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Sure.  How about this weekend?  Calvin:  Um, it would be better to do it a little sooner.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  When is this due?  Calvin:  Well, my notebook&#39;s in the car and the park closes in 20 minutes.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Calvin, I&#39;m fixing dinner!

I can&#39;t believe Mom wouldn&#39;t take me to the arboretum.  No wonder I get bad grades!  Hobbes:  Well, you did spring the idea on her at the last second..    Calvin:  That&#39;s when I thought of it!  The problem is that Mom&#39;s not flexible.  What a stupid waste of time this is!  I wish there was some way out of this assignment.

Alien 1:  We are taking over your world.  Calvin:  You are??  What for??  Alien 1:  Earth is prime real estate.  Alien 2:  Location, location, location.  Calvin:  I guess I&#39;d never thought about that.  Alien 1:  Charm, atmosphere, quiet galaxy...  Hobbes:  Actually, the atmosphere needs cleaning.  Alien 2:  A good fixer upper.

Alien 1:  You make this difficult.  Alien 2:  Prepare for war.  Calvin:  Let&#39;s not be hasty.  I&#39;ll trade you Earth for 50 alien tree leaves.  Alien 1:  Pst!  These primitive fools must use leaves as currency!  Alien 2:  It&#39;s a deal!  Calvin:  I need them by 8:00 tonight, and they have to be properly identified and labeled.  Alien 1:  Hurry, Nebular!  At light speed, we can just make it!  Alien 2:  Our leader will be most pleased.

Calvin:  I&#39;ll have the coolest project in the class!  And best of all, now we don&#39;t need to waste any more time on this!  The aliens are doing all the work!  We can goof off the rest of the day!  Hobbes:  But then the aliens take over the Earth.  Calvin:  Well it&#39;s not like the grownups have done such a bang-up job.

I like the cool days, the smell of leaves, the low sunlight...and the sky looks even more blue when the trees are yellow and red! Calvin: I dunno...I think autumn is melancholy. Summer if over an ina week or two, everything will be hankered down for the long bleak winter. Nothing lasts, fall is just the last fling before things get worse. Hobbes: If good things lasted forever, would we appreciate how precious they are? Calvin: I like to have everything so good. I can take it all for granted. Hobbes: I think the brisk air makes apple pie taste better too! Mm-mm!

Calvin:  It&#39;s a long trip.  Hobbes:  What if they don&#39;t show up?    Calvin:  They said they would.  Hobbes:  Maybe they got lost.  Calvin:  Space aliens don&#39;t get lost!  They&#39;ve got superior technology!  Everybody knows that!  Hobbes:  It&#39;s a big universe.  Calvin:  I&#39;ll turn on some more lights.

What are we going to do??  I&#39;ve got to turn in my leaf collection tomorrow!  I&#39;ll bet those dumb aliens got back to their planet and procrastinated!  I&#39;ll bet they have no respect for deadlines!  I&#39;ll bet they put everything off and are doing a lousy job at the last second!  Hobbes:  How could anyone be so irresponsible?  Calvin:  If they&#39;re not here in five minutes, I&#39;m not handing over the Earth!  They&#39;ve got to learn a lesson!

I&#39;ll bet you were up late doing your leaf collection.  Calvin:  Maybe, but I&#39;ve got the best collection of all!  My leaves are from another planet!  Susie Derkins (friend):  What?!  Calvin:  See how bizarre they are?  The labels are even written in an alien language!  Look at their cool alphabet!  Susie Derkins (friend):  It looks like you took 50 maple leaves and cut them into weird shapes.  Calvin:  Aliens now own the Earth and I told them girls make good zoo exhibits.

She said it was obvious I did the whole thing last night and I made a mockery of the assignment.  Well, she&#39;ll be sorry when the aliens send her to the plutonium mines.  She just won&#39;t admit it was a pointless project.  Who cares about leaves?!  What useless knowledge!  Hobbes:  I believe that&#39;s poison sumac you&#39;re holding.  Calvin:  This??

If it was completely different, school would be great.  Hobbes:  A lot of things are like that.  Calvin:  Nobady asks me how things ought to be.  I&#39;ve got tons of ideas!

Computers will take care of every task.  We&#39;ll just point to what we want done and click.  We&#39;ll never need to leave the climate-controlled comfort of our homes!

Calvin:  It&#39;s a metaphor for life, Hobbes.  Each egg represents one of life&#39;s concerns and the goal is to give each the appropriate amount of individual attention while simultaneously watching and guiding all the others.  Life is about balance and staying quick and alert as everything threatens to spin out of control!  Hobbes:  And sometimes we make a big mess of things.  Calvin:  But the important thing is persistance.

Do you read me?  Over!  *Khkkhhkt*  Miss Wormwood:  I&#39;ll take the walkie-talkie.  You take the test.  Calvin:  Ixsay inusmay  ourfay!  Urryhay!

Adult:  Where&#39;s your costume?  What are you supposed to be?  Calvin:  I&#39;m yet another resource-consuming kid in an overpopulated planet, raised to an alarming extent by Madison Avenue and Hollywood, poised with my cynical and alienated peers to take over the world when you&#39;re old and weak!  Am I scary, or what?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/cd73d500e0680131732c005056a9545d|306|900|Calvin:  I can&#39;t help but wonder what kind of desperate straits would drive a man to invent this thing.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/cebcffa0e0680131732c005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  Look!  Geese flying south for the winter.  Twice a year they migrate thousands of miles across the continent in an exhausting, eternal struggle to fulfill natures unyielding demands!  I&#39;ll bet that gets old real fast.  Hobbes:  You don&#39;t see me keeping a summer home.

Why don&#39;t I have a bunch of friends with nothing to do but drop by and instigate wacky adventures?  Why aren&#39;t my conversations peppered with spontaneous witticisms?  Why don&#39;t my friends demonstrate heartfelt concern for my well-being when I have problems?  Hobbes:  Why don&#39;t you know any gorgeous babes?  Calvin:  I gotta get my life some writers.

Day by day nothing seems to change, but pretty soon, everything is different.  You just go about your business and one day you realize you&#39;re not the same person you used to be.  People change whether they decide to or not!  Hobbes:  Thank heaven for small favors.  Calvin:  For example, I used to be more tolerant of oblique aspersions.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|5|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/05|https://assets.amuniversal.com/334c1000784e01302116001dd8b71c47|623|900|Calvin: I&#39;m home! ...sighhhhhhhh... My life could stand a lot more pizzazz. Mom: Tell me about it.

Maybe it&#39;s been an hour.  Well, actually it&#39;s probably been only 40 minutes.  I&#39;ll guess half an hour to be safe.  20 seconds?!?  It&#39;s going to be a very bad day.  Miss Wormwood (teacher):  Calvin, sit up.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|7|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/07|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d3d313d0e0680131732c005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  I&#39;m in a very crabby mood, so everybody just leave me alone!  I hate everyone!!  Nobody recognizes my hints to smother me with affection.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|8|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/08|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d51839e0e0680131732c005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  As a genius, it&#39;s important that I write a lot of letters.  After all, my correspondence will be the basic resource material for historians to reconstruct my life.  My writing will provide countless fascinating insights for biographers.  Hobbes:  Such as how all your salutations begin, &quot;Hey boogerbrain.&quot;  Calvin:  It&#39;s been three weeks and I still haven&#39;t received my x-ray glasses!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|9|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/09|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d65f3cf0e0680131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Yikes!  Not another extreme close-up on somebody&#39;s anguish and grief!  Why do TV cameras zoom in so close to people&#39;s faces that you can&#39;t even see their entire heads?!  Do they think we can&#39;t read the person&#39;s expression from more that two inches away?!  What a violation of personal space!  What a shameless intrusion!  What a heartless assault on human dignity!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Why are you standing against the wall?  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  I&#39;m watching TV.

This stupid toaster burned my toast!!  Look at this!  My toast is charred to a black cinder!  I can&#39;t eat this!  It&#39;s ruined!  Ruined!!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  So stick in another piece of bread and watch it this time.  Calvin:  Are you suggesting that this appliance didn&#39;t aggravate me with malice aforethought?!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|11|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/11|https://assets.amuniversal.com/d8e014b0e0680131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  I keep having the same weird dream every night.  Hobbes:  If it&#39;s the same dream, it must mean something.  Calvin:  I think it means the fall season flopped and my subconcious went into reruns.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|12|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/12|https://assets.amuniversal.com/37718070784e01302116001dd8b71c47|620|900|Calvin: Now if it would only snow! Hobbes: While we&#39;re waiting, I&#39;ll draw  more spirals above Susie&#39;s head.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|13|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/13|https://assets.amuniversal.com/da364e50e0680131732c005056a9545d|297|900|Calvin:  Brrr, it&#39;s freezing out there!  I don&#39;t want to leave my nice warm bed.  On days like this, I wish Mom would come in, lay an extra blanket over me.  Pat my head, and as I sink into the pillow under the weight of the covers, she&#39;d say...  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Hey, let&#39;s move it!!  This is the third time I&#39;ve called you!  You&#39;re going to miss the bus!  Let&#39;s go!!  Calvin:  These mornings are going to kill me.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|14|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/14|https://assets.amuniversal.com/db9233c0e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  The pace of modern life is all wrong.  It makes every day an ordeal.  Everybody&#39;s exhausted, stressed out, and short-tempered!  Look at me!  Why am I waiting for a bus at this horrible hour?!  It&#39;s unnatural and unhealthy!  We should ease into the day!  You know, read the paper, have some hot cocoa, go for a leisurely walk and get our thoughts together...  Hobbes:  So now it&#39;s mid-afternonn.  Calvin:  Right.  Time to kick back for a little siesta and plan dinner.

Don&#39;t divide it up!  Give it all to me!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Don&#39;t be selfish, Calvin.  Calvin:  So the real message here is &quot;be dishonest&quot;?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|16|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/16|https://assets.amuniversal.com/de45f860e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Uhhgg...manicotti!  Gross!  Aiee!  My intestines just burst through my stomach wall!  Susie Derkins (friend):  Aaaa!!  Calvin:  I should get some more and see if I can get out of math class.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|17|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/17|https://assets.amuniversal.com/df8dfbc0e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  This is a photograph of me when I was two.  It&#39;s strange.  I know that&#39;s me, but I don&#39;t feel any connection to this image.  Everything is so different now.  Isn&#39;t it weird that one&#39;s own past can seem unreal?  This is like looking at a picture of somebody else.  Hobbes:  Say, a slobbering nudist with legs like link sausages.  Calvin:  You know, now I can&#39;t stand to wad a soggy blanket in my mouth.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e0d500d0e0680131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Here&#39;s a picture of me when I was three.  Look at that smile!  Ahh, the arrogance of youth!  I thought I knew everything when I was three.  Hobbes:  And you expwethed aww that knowwedge wike thith.  Calvin:  Now, a lifetime of experience has left me bitter and cynical.

Calvin:  Why??  It&#39;s no contest!  You&#39;ve got the entire advantage!  What could you possibly get out of pounding someone completely defenseless!  Moe (bully):  It&#39;s fun.  Calvin:  Oh, he&#39;s a sportsman.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|21|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/21|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e36437f0e0680131732c005056a9545d|295|900|Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Hello?  Calvin:  Hi Mom, it&#39;s Calvin.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Is something wrong?  You&#39;re supposed to be in school!  Calvin:  It&#39;s recess.  I&#39;m fine.  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Then why are you calling me?  Calvin:  Actually, I&#39;m calling Hobbes.  Would you put him on?  I gotta get my own secretary.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e4a324b0e0680131732c005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  Ooh, it&#39;s cold today!  It needs to be 30 degrees warmer out here!  For that matter, it&#39;s also too quiet.  We need some background music.  And it&#39;s too slow!  Things should happen more quickly!  Hobbes:  If only being outside were more like driving a car.  Calvin:  Yeah, I could be sitting down now too.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e5e66cd0e0680131732c005056a9545d|290|900|Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Calvin, will you gather the trash, please?  Calvin:  Why should I?  What do I get in return?!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  We will feed, clothe, shelter, and educate you throughout your entire youth.  Calvin:  I really hate having things put in perspective.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e72cef00e0680131732c005056a9545d|290|900|Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  How could anyone wear out shoes so fast?  Calvin:  I lead a rugged life.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|25|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/25|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e86761b0e0680131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  I wish it would snow!  I know when I&#39;m being mocked.

I think it&#39;s because conflict is drama, drama is entertaining, and entertainment is marketable.  Finding consensus and common ground is dull! Nobody wants to watch a civilized discussion that acknowledges ambiguity and complexity. We want to see fireworks!  We want the sense of solidarity and identity that comes from having our interestes narrowed and exploited by like-minded zealots!  Talk show hosts, political candidates, news programs, special interest groups... They all become successful by reducing debates to the level of shouted rage. Nothing gets solved, but we&#39;re all entertained.  Hobbes: Hmmm, you may be right.   Calvin: What a boring day this turned out to be!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/e9b4d160e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  People keep talking about opening more wilderness for development.  We seem to understand the value of oil, timber, minerals, and housing, but not the value of unspoiled beauty, wildlife, solitude, and spiritual renewal.  Hobbes:  We need to start putting prices on the priceless.  Calvin:  Yeah, if our woods are worth a zillion bagillion, think what Alaska is worth.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|28|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/28|https://assets.amuniversal.com/eaf4c7e0e0680131732c005056a9545d|296|900|Calvin:  It&#39;s freezing in here!!  Why can&#39;t we crank up the thermostat?!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  Consuming less fuel is better for the environment and it saves money.  Calvin:  Oh.  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  ...And being cold builds character.  Calvin:  I knew it!!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|29|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/29|https://assets.amuniversal.com/ec2ae840e0680131732c005056a9545d|288|900|Calvin:  These are interesting times.  We don&#39;t trust the government, we don&#39;t trust the legal system, we don&#39;t trust the media, and we don&#39;t trust each other!  We&#39;ve undermined all authority, and with it, the basis for replacing it!  Hobbes:  &quot;Interesting&quot; is a mild way of putting it.  Calvin:  It&#39;s like a six-year-old&#39;s dream come true!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|11|30|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/11/30|https://assets.amuniversal.com/ed750110e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Radio:  You&#39;re listening to &quot;Boomer 102&quot;  classic rock--where we promise not to expose you to anything you haven&#39;t heard a million times before!  We&#39;ll get right back to more hits from those high school days when your world stopped...but first, here&#39;s our critic to review the latest movie based on a &#39;60s or &#39;70s TV show!  Dad (Calvin&#39;s father):  What&#39;s that look supposed to mean?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|1|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/01|https://assets.amuniversal.com/eec05360e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  Ever notice how many conversations revolve around TV shows and movies?  Our common references are events that never happened and people we&#39;ll never meet!  We know more about celebrities and fictional characters than we know about out neighbors!  Hobbes:  That must be why new houses aren&#39;t built with big front porches anymore.  Calvin:  I can&#39;t believe Dad won&#39;t le me have a TV in my own room.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|2|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/02|https://assets.amuniversal.com/f0057700e0680131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Calvin:  I like the sound of sleet hitting the window panes at night.  And I like when the sleet turns to heavy snow as it gets colder, so you know that tomorrow the world will be buried in ice and snow!  It&#39;s one of the few pleasures reserved for those who don&#39;t drive.

Hobbes: How about this rock? It has a purple stripe.  Calvin: Hmmm...I guess that&#39;s a little weird.  Hobbes: We&#39;ll look for something weirder.  Calvin: What do you think of this stick?  Hobbes: It&#39;s a strange stick, but it&#39;s not a weird stick.  Calvin: It&#39;s too bad there aren&#39;t any good bugs out now.  Hobbes: Yes, bugs are usually weird.  Calvin: Hey, here&#39;s a bird feather.  Hobbes: It&#39;s pretty, but it&#39;s not weird.  Calvin: A bald bird would be weird.  Hobbes: I don&#39;t see one.  Calvin: Look! A ripped-up old kite! Some kid must have lost this last summer!  Phooey. The string broke here. I was hoping to find the kid&#39;s skeleton up a tree at the other end.  Hobbes: That would be weird.  Calvin: Well, let&#39;s go in. I&#39;m cold.  Hobbes: Me too. I guess some days weirdness is hard to find.  Dad: My glasses are fogged and I can&#39;t blow my nose, but my heart rate is the envy of men half my age!  Calvin: Weirdness always starts at home.  Hobbes: Even when you look for it, you&#39;re never prepared for it.

Calvin:  I got the idea from car ads.

Hobbes:  An evil Santa??  Calvin:  Yeah, like Santa&#39;s deranged twin brother, or something!  He&#39;d make toys for all the bad girls and boys!  Evil Santa would give all the dangerous, annoying, and corrupting toys your parents won&#39;t allow!  Hobbes:  And if you&#39;re good?  Calvin:  He punishes you with shirts and underwear.

Calvin:  Oh.  Time to prepare my appellate case.

I&#39;m mailing a letter to Santa right now!  Calvin:  Is the envelope already sealed?  Susie Derkins (friend):  Yes, but I could write a P.S. on the back.  Calvin:  Do you have a pen?  Susie Derkins (friend):  As a matter of fact, I do!  Calvin:  I&#39;ll bet she&#39;s bluffing, but this isn&#39;t the time of year to tempt fate.

Hobbes: What snowball?  Calvin: Ohhhhh, don&#39;t play innocent with me, buster! That snowball had your name written all over it!  Hobbes: Oh yeah?? Calvin: Yeah! It was sneaky, fiendish, vicious, treacherous, grim, and ruthless! Put all that together and it spells &#39;tiger&#39;!  Hobbes: No it doesn&#39;t! It spells &quot;Calvin&#39;s new name is Mr. Stupid Soggyshorts!&quot;  Calvin: Ooh, that does it!  Calvin/Hobbes: Oh! Hey! Stop that! Quit it! No fair! No biting!  Susie: Hey Calvin, you should&#39;ve seen your expression when I hit you with that snowball!  Ha ha!  Calvin: Ah, heh heh

I am utterly invincible!  I can act with total impunity!  I can do whatever I want!  So just hang on while I decide what that is!

My will is law!  I am omnipotent!  How boring.

In the long term, it would make me happier to do well at school and become successful.  But in the very long term, I know which will make better memories.

What a rotten snowman!  That&#39;s the worst snowman I&#39;ve ever seen!  Susie Derkins (friend):  So go build a better one!  Calvin:  Maybe I will!  Susie Derkins (friend):  You&#39;re back?  Calvin:  My words speak louder than actions.

Hobbes: I don&#39;t see a path.  Calvin: We&#39;ll make a path!  Hobbes: Huh boy.  Calvin: Change is invigorating! If you don&#39;t accept new challenges, you become complacent and lazy! Your life atrophies!  New experiences lead to new questions and new solutions! Change forces us to experiment and adapt! That&#39;s how we learn and grow!  Whoops... Well, here&#39;s a fresh challenge.  Hobbes: I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s opened up new horizons.  The problem with new experiences is that they&#39;re so rarely the ones you choose.  Calvin: I feel smarter already.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|18|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/18|https://assets.amuniversal.com/013c9030e0690131732c005056a9545d|291|900|Calvin:  The Christmas season is always a time for personal reflection.  Too often we don&#39;t examine our lives.  This is a time to take stock and think about what&#39;s important.  It&#39;s a time to rededicate oneself to frenzied acquisition...a time to spread the joy of material wealth...a time to glorify personal excess of every kind!  Hobbes:  Earthly rewards make consumerism a popular religion.  Calvin:  ...A time to atone for one&#39;s frugality!

It must be six inches deep!  This will be perfect for sledding or...  All right!  I&#39;m coming!  I&#39;m coming!  Alien:  What the heck is wrong with this planet you sold us?!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|20|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/20|https://assets.amuniversal.com/04aa2160e0690131732c005056a9545d|287|900|Calvin:  Galaxoid and Nebular!  Alien 2:  This cold white glop covers us and freezes our innards!  Calvin:  It&#39;s snow.  You&#39;d better get used to it, &#39;cause we get it every winter.  Alien 1:  You did not tell us that this planet&#39;s axis would tilt us away from the sun.  Calvin:  You didn&#39;t ask.  Alien 1:  We paid 50 leaves for this planet!  You greatly overcharged us!  Calvin:  Yeah well, &quot;let the buyer beware.&quot;  Alien 2:  You are a most dishonorable potentate!  Alien 1:  We demand you bring this planet up to code!

Calvin:  Aahh!  Um..uh..girl scouts!  Do we want any cookies?  Alien 1:  Girl scouts?  Cookies?  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  It seems early, but sure, let me get my purse.  Calvin:  Oh no!  Scram, you guys!  Alien 2:  Not until you fix the climate!  Calvin:  I&#39;ll see what I can do.  Alien 2:  Do not trifle with us, Earth leader!  Mom (Calvin&#39;s mother):  Where are the girl scouts?  Calvin:  They suddenly had to go earn a merit badge.  Quick, where&#39;s Hobbes?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|22|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/22|https://assets.amuniversal.com/07d1b2f0e0690131732c005056a9545d|289|900|Hobbes:  The aliens didn&#39;t know about winter?  Calvin:  They claim I sold them a planet with a faulty axis!  What should I do?  Hobbes:  Offer a refund.  Give back their leaf collection.  Calvin:  Arrggh!  I threw it away when it got such a bad grade!  Hobbes:  Hmm...well, we should at least help them stay warm then.  Calvin:  But what could they wear?  They don&#39;t even have arms!...They need huge socks or something.  Hey!  No!  Bad idea!  Bad idea!
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|23|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/23|https://assets.amuniversal.com/094a5140e0690131732c005056a9545d|290|900|Alien 1:  Ooh, this is toasty!  Alien 2:  Thank you, Earth leader!  Calvin:  That&#39;s my Christmas stocking!  They&#39;re going away with our stockings!  Santa can&#39;t fill &#39;em with loot!  Hobbes:  I&#39;m sure Santa knows we did a nice thing and he&#39;ll work it all out.  Calvin:  Hey yeah, I did something good!  We&#39;re talking jackpot!  We&#39;re talking multiple trips from the pole to haul it all!  Hobbes:  Your selflessness is the hope of the season.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|24|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/24|https://assets.amuniversal.com/52ed7a80784e01302116001dd8b71c47|625|900|Santa Claus: OK boys, have we loaded everything?  Elf: Ah, there&#39;s still the matter of this Calvin, sir. His list is 30 pages long, not including the supplement about incendiary weapons. The research dept. thought you should handle this personally.  Santa Claus: Well, is he naughty or nice?  Elf: Ah, a bit problematic, chief... Here&#39;s his dossier... Santa Claus: Ohhhh yes, the &quot;noodle incident&quot; kid... Elf: That was a while ago, boss. He says he was framed, and we&#39;ve had trouble verifying the particulars. Accounts seem to vary.  Santa Claus: What about all these slushballs thrown at the girl down the street?  My my my!  Elf: No dispute there. Surveillance documents some 400 incidents, but the kid claims extenuating circumstances.  Santa Claus: Hmmm...don&#39;t they all.  Elf: A tiger vouches for the kid&#39;s character...Says the kid tries to be sort of good if he&#39;s not tempted otherwise.  Santa Claus: What do his parents say?  Elf: Here&#39;s the dad&#39;s comments. We&#39;re looking into the sarcasm factor.  Santa Claus: All right. I&#39;ve made up my mind. Is the boy asleep yet?  Elf: Ah, no, he&#39;s wide awake.  Hobbes: Santa won&#39;t come until we&#39;re asleep, you know.  Calvin: I can&#39;t take the suspense!

Hobbes:  It&#39;s over here.  Calvin:  A pile of ready-made snowballs!  Hobbes:  I wanted to give you something practical.  Calvin:  You&#39;re the best, Hobbes, ol&#39; buddy!  Thanks!  Hobbes:  Merry Christmas.  Calvin:  I suppose it would be wrong to throw these at you...  Hobbes:  I made my own pile, just in case.
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|26|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/26|https://assets.amuniversal.com/0c3c5e60e0690131732c005056a9545d|292|900|Hobbes:  What&#39;s this?  Calvin:  A generic snowman.  I used to make original snowmen, but it was time-consuming, hard work, so I said, heck, this is crazy!  Now I crank out crude imitations of what&#39;s already popular!  It takes no time or thought, and most people don&#39;t care about the difference anyway!  Hobbes:  So cynical, yet so practical.  Calvin:  And what good is originality if you can&#39;t crank it out?
Sat Dec 30 1995 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)|1995|12|27|https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/12/27|https://assets.amuniversal.com/0da5e990e0690131732c005056a9545d|290|900|Calvin:  The new issue of Chewing tells how to stay in top chewing condition over the winter!  Hobbes:  What&#39;s so hard about that?  You can chew gum all year.  Calvin:  We serious chewers need a lot more than strong jaw muscles, you know!  To chew hour after hour, we need a total cross-training fitness regime!  Hobbes:  So the idea is to increase the amount of this hobby you can endure.  Calvin:  Right.  When you&#39;re good at it, it&#39;s really miserable.

In the dark, it&#39;s easier to imagine awful possibilities that you&#39;d never be prepared for.  And it&#39;s hard to feel courageous in loose-fitting, Drowsy Bear jammies.  Hobbes:  That&#39;s why tigers sleep in the buff!

He&#39;s enjoying a snow cone!  There&#39;s nothing he likes better!  Hobbes:  And the snowman with the ice cream scoop in his back?  Calvin:  It&#39;s a sordid story.

Calvin:  Yeah, I&#39;m resolving to just wing it and see what happens.  Hobbes:  So you&#39;re staying the course?  Calvin:  I stick to my strengths.

Isn&#39;t it wonderful?  Hobbes: Everything familiar has disappeared! The world looks brand-new!  Calvin: A new year... a fresh, clean start!  Hobbes: I&#39;s like having a big white sheet of paper to draw on!  Calvin: A day full of possibilities!  It&#39;s a magical world, Hobbes, ol&#39; buddy... Let&#39;s go exploring!
